    <p>On my second full day in Berlin I wanted to see a museum of technology I had found, try some more quintessentially German food, and wander across the major park Tiergarten. Alongside a lovely person that <a href="http://dpk.io">David</a> put me in touch with, I achieved all but the last.</p>

<p>I’m writing to you from the 11:04 service from Berlin to Prague, on the last leg of my journey. But more about that next time.</p>

<p>[PHOTOS FROM OUTSIDE MUSEUM, AND SUMMARY OF ITS LAYOUT ETC?]</p>

<p>Rather than just presenting artefacts in pristine condition, it has non-pristine exhibits and gives the science behind them.</p>

<p>The aerospace exhibit has a number of recovered crashed aircraft, including a Stuka dive-bomber and an Avro Lancaster. It seemed quite ‘different’ to exhibit these aircraft rather than those in prime condition, and yet it’s much easier to see into and understand a mangled airframe!</p>

<p>[CRASHED PLANE PHOTOS]</p>

<p>The floor dedicated to Deep Water Shipping has four segments of ship hull: one of wood with necessary bonds, one with iron ribs and wooden plate, one with iron ribs and iron plate, and one of welded steel girder and iron plate. This is a great demonstration of how different constructions have different properties but this brings us to something to be aware of - only about 20% of the exhibits have English translations.</p>

<p>[SHIP CONSTRUCTION PHOTOS?]</p>

<p>The extent of English translation varies - the Zuse exhibition has excellent, detailed English translation throughout, whereas the aerospace floors have one-sentence summaries of the large-scale summaries and the individual artefact labels are not translated. This does not make a visit a waste of time in any way, especially for €5 entry with a WelcomeCard, but it’s something to go expecting.</p>

<p>[ZUSE EXHIBITION PHOTOS]</p>

<p>Altogether an incredible experience, combining the best of German technology with information on how events of the 20th Century guided it. If you can read German then budget the whole day or otherwise 4-5 hours. Don’t forget about the park (they have windmills!), trainsheds and Networks areas.</p>

<p>[WINDMILL AND ETC PHOTOS]</p>

<p>This museum was chiefly focused on the industry around Berlin, but from what I’m told there is an even larger museum in Munich that focuses more on Germany as a whole.</p>

<p>On the roof there’s a great view towards central Berlin.</p>

<p>[ROOF PHOTOS]</p>

<p>You can go up the TV tower (the one with a sphere at the top), but while there are many major buildings there aren’t many skyline buildings. From what I’ve read the TV tower itself is one of the main things to see on the skyline and thus it isn’t all that impressive.</p>
