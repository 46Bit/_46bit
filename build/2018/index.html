  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2018/weeknote-3/">Weeknote 3</a></h2>
  <p>I missed a weeknote. Interesting things happened but I went through a period of being down and having crippling hayfever.</p>

<h2 id="i-learned-lots-about-leading-in-an-agile-environment">I learned lots about leading in an agile environment</h2>

<p>A difficulty with working at GDS is how exposing collaborative ways of working can be. There are lots of potential triggers, like teams expecting pair programming and not building in ay recharge time. There are lots of things one has to work with, such as being overwhelmed out by bright office lights.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve learned to work around these things. Finding recharge time can be a question of seeing yourself as being <em>in</em> the team rather than <em>of</em> it. Bright office lights can be mitigated by polarising sunglasses, and hopefully by something more stylish in time. And I learned a lot along the way.</p>

<p>We seem to learn more from unpleasant experiences than from enjoyable ones. It‚Äôs hard to know <em>why</em> something successful works without asking a lot of questions, and some questions risk surfacing lingering issues and creating drama. I suppose that the people we <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development#Storming">storm with</a> can become deeply respected and appreciated friends‚Ä¶ if things normalise.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve been talking to quite a few Delivery Managers and Product Managers, and I shadowed <a href="https://twitter.com/probablyreading">one of my favouritest Delivery Managers</a>. I‚Äôm fascinating by the agile team structures that we use, but they are quite synthetic. They work because people divide responsibilities, not because people are <em>necessarily</em> lacking in abilities. The roleplaying allows focus, gives room for other people to focus on other roles, and thus allows for effective teams!</p>

<p>GDS ask interviewing Developers about experience of leadership. I kept quiet because it isn‚Äôt necessary for mid-level, and I doubted my experiences in smaller orgs with informal leadership was relevant. At this stage: a lot of that was the stereotyped self-doubt that marginalised people get when applying for roles. The missing ingredient in applying my leadership experience to GDS wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhow does one lead?‚Äù but ‚Äúwhy do we have roles?‚Äù</p>

<p>This is all opinion. Much of it is influenced by others; the exact understanding is mine. I think it‚Äôs a way forward. As I learn more of my triggers, and keep finding new opportunities to exercise myself in different team situations, I‚Äôll get closer and closer to being a credible tech lead. It might take a long time, but that‚Äôs particular to <em>this</em> way of working. If I wanted I could find a different organisation that I could lead in right now‚Äîbut this arbitrary way of working that we have is damned effective, caring of people, and worth my effort to learn.</p>

<h2 id="the-other-things-ive-been-doing">The other things I‚Äôve been doing</h2>

<p>I‚Äôve said all that without mentioning what I‚Äôve actually being doing most of the time! I think I‚Äôll talk about that next time. I‚Äôve done lots of learning and some changing to GOV.UK Verify infrastructure, supporting multiple teams‚Äô needs simultaneously, becoming more confident approaching unknown people that might not be able to help me, trying/maybe-failing/reflecting to teach Terraform skills to (junior) developers, making further progress on hosting Queer Code London at GDS, debugging S3 bucket policies, working on my <a href="https://github.com/46bit/tilewater">Tilewater</a> game in Rust, thinking about how/if a team could shorten standups to be a feasible standing-up duration, befriending other REs, even practicing how to be gently intimidating so I have a defence mechanism if I ever need one, investigating sporadically elevated <code class="highlighter-rouge">502</code> error rates, ‚Ä¶ and at least a dozen other things.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2018/weeknote-2/">Weeknote 2</a></h2>
  <p>This was a short week. Monday was a Bank Holiday. On Wednesday I stayed at home because of sinus fatigue (hayfever sucks!) and didn‚Äôt get much done. But I did some proper infrastructure work this week.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2018/weeknote-1/">Weeknote 1</a></h2>
  <p>Since joining GDS I‚Äôve learned a lot about infrastructure and ways of working like agile and XP. And I‚Äôve contributed a lot back to my team from that. But after 10 months I needed to get some wider context, and see how other teams work. To that end I‚Äôm helping a product team deploy its infrastructure for private beta.</p>

<p>I spent last week starting to understand my new team‚Äôs culture and mission, investigating the project I‚Äôm helping deploy, researching ways of packaging Java/JVM projects for release (e.g., fat JARs), and arranging community things.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve decided I want to try Sketchnoting. I don‚Äôt have much experience of drawing things, and I thought a friendly character would be a good start. So I focused on finding that character first:</p>

  <p>When I started web development in the early 2000s, your typical medium sized website ran on a single codebase that ran in exactly the same way on a few webservers. The frontend, things like accessibility and JavaScript, felt like novelties.</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs been quite the Winter for snow in North London. My first winter here has been just as lucky as
was my first in York, which is when I took this photograph.</p>
