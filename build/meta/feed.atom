And this seemed strange, because I was evidently doing well and enjoying work and I did not &lt;em&gt;objectively&lt;/em&gt; feel lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been learning about an area of psychology called attachment theory, and it turns out that people don’t work that way. Something called the Dependency Paradox describes how people without reliable relationships can struggle to feel comfortable in their independence, whereas once those relationships are settled and reliable the same people will be independent and unconcerned. This lack is why I was feeling so upset for a time, but also why things have felt dramatically lighter in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been hard. I’ve been pursuing a lot of difficult angles. At times I’ve been talking about the same areas with multiple people: the past with my therapist, the present with my mentors, and the future with my line manager. This seems like one of the side effects of a relationship-based culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know where I first came across the concept of a relationship-based culture, but I’ve found it useful in understanding why I like GDS whereas other large organisations seemed quite oppressive from the outside. Rather than following a strict hierarchy or playing fixed roles, we do our best to contribute as best we can in the ways that we best can. Much of that is by forming strong relationships with those around us, and that directly links to the relationships going on in our life outside work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can go too far. I cringe when people describe hierarchied work-focused groups as being a community, because they intentionally have &lt;em&gt;formal&lt;/em&gt; power imbalances and that’s not what I expect from a community. In practice our tech communities feel more like guilds. It’s a tricky issue: to call them communities is to minimise the power imbalances; to call them guilds risks maximising it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Power is an area I’ve been learning to understand more. A few months I was remarked to that my opinions often ‘saved lives’ and I could do with being more persuasive. This took me out of nowhere, because I felt that I did contribute my opinions fully. But as best I understand it, this is because human beings often respond more to displays of confidence than to the reasoned quality of ideas. I despair a little at humanity over this but I also recognise that people get tired, are doing their best, and I can’t change humanity. So I had to get better at that–and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; I could use that persuasion to ensure that quieter but better ideas got heard (not just my own–those of others!) This inner frustration is ironic, considering how much time I spent trying to explain to engineers that people are not purely rational and act in paradoxical ways if you do not appreciate the role of their personalities. But, well, I am autistic; these two&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this makes me uncomfortable. Knowing how to communicate assertively can be repurposed to communicate aggressively or manipulatively, and our own moral compass and the reactions of others is all we have to go on. Human interaction is often in shades of grey. Observe how common extremely assertive (and aggressive) communication is amongst London commuters. This is a bit dreadful for someone from quiet Northern cities, but it is efficient because it stops things getting personal, clearly sets expectations, and keeps people focused on getting where they are going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These areas are interesting. They’ve kept me busy. I have some clear goals now for how to develop my people, organisational and leadership skills further. Best of all I have three people that I feel like I can rely on seeing every week or two, and thirty I can rely on seeing about. Those attachments are important, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/are-we-born-racist/201205/the-dependency-paradox-why-people-are-not-feet&quot;&gt;people are not like feet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been quite distressing to see my insecurities rising since I moved down. But it’s made me stronger. I know my triggers a lot better now, and the traumatic experiences behind them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know from experience and understanding that insecure people make terrible leaders: power imbalances can bring out their worst. But those experiences have generally been with people who were unaware, in denial, or not seeing someone about it. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; my self-esteem needs work, and I’m working quite intensely on it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In December I wrote about how painful I had found it to leave York, move to London by myself, and start putting this new phase of life together.

Interesting things happened but I went through a period of being down and having crippling hayfever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;i-learned-lots-about-leading-in-an-agile-environment&quot;&gt;I learned lots about leading in an agile environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A difficulty with working at GDS is how exposing collaborative ways of working can be. There are lots of potential triggers, like teams expecting pair programming and not building in ay recharge time. There are lots of things one has to work with, such as being overwhelmed by bright office lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve learned to work around these things. Finding recharge time can be a question of seeing yourself as being &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; the team rather than &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; it. Bright office lights can be mitigated by polarising sunglasses, and hopefully by something more stylish in time. And I’ve learned a lot along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We seem to learn more from unpleasant experiences than from enjoyable ones. It’s hard to know &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; something successful works without asking a lot of questions, and some questions risk surfacing lingering issues and creating drama. I suppose that the people we &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman%27s_stages_of_group_development#Storming&quot;&gt;storm with&lt;/a&gt; can become deeply respected and appreciated friends as things normalise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been talking to quite a few Delivery Managers and Product Managers, and I shadowed &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/probablyreading&quot;&gt;one of my favouritest Delivery Managers&lt;/a&gt;. I’m fascinating by the agile team structures that we use, and their deliberate structures. I had always felt that stereotyping people into roles was oppressive, and would be suffocating to roleplay. But these structures work &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; people divide responsibilities—not because people are necessarily lacking in relevant abilities. With divided responsibilities comes more focus, clearer lines to collaborate along, and thus more effective teams. When you understand your role you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; subvert it in ways that work for you (for instance, some Delivery Managers take a keener interest on the Product side of things.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example is that Product Managers sometimes need to be “a product arse”—very outspoken in advocating for the product. This could ruin morale or burn the team out, except that other roles are there to speak out for what’s humanly and technically possible. When you can count on the other roles in a team to complement your role, you achieve more together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GDS ask interviewing Developers about experience of leadership. I kept quiet because it isn’t necessary for mid-level, and I doubted my experiences in smaller orgs with informal leadership was relevant. At this stage: a lot of that was the stereotyped self-doubt that marginalised people get when applying for roles. The missing ingredient in applying my leadership experience to GDS wasn’t “how does one lead?” but “why do we have roles?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all opinion. Much of it is influenced by others; the exact understanding is mine. I think it’s a way forward. As I learn more of my triggers, and keep finding new opportunities to exercise myself in different team situations, I’ll get closer and closer to being a credible tech lead. This might take a long time, but that’s particular to &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; way of working, and if I wanted I could find a different organisation that I could lead in right now. But GDS’s ways of working care about people, deliver great products, and are worth my effort to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-other-things-ive-been-doing&quot;&gt;The other things I’ve been doing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve said all that without mentioning what I’ve actually being doing most of the time! I think I’ll talk about that next time. I’ve done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lots of learning and some changing to GOV.UK Verify infrastructure;&lt;/li&gt;

Monday was a Bank Holiday. On Wednesday I stayed at home because of sinus fatigue (hayfever sucks!) and didn’t get much done. But I did some proper infrastructure work this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;aws-lambda&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some teams within GDS are experimenting with using &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&quot;&gt;AWS Lambda&lt;/a&gt;, a service that runs your code for you and saves worrying about servers or containers and only charges you for its compute time. The team I’m visiting is trying it for deploying an hourly batch job, and I’m helping because of delays with the main thing I’m there for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system’s aim is for a web endpoint that fetches several resources, verifies their signatures, and saves them into an object store. It’s a cache that also verifies signatures. We’re using a Lambda function for that web endpoint, and an S3 bucket as the object store, but there’s several more components needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.terraform.io&quot;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt; to define the infrastructure into code, but sadly this isn’t in the open. To be consistent with other projects we don’t want to use Terraform to deploy code to the Lambda, so we’ve had to find a different way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borrowing from an approach AWS advised, we’ve created an extra Lambda function and S3 bucket. This “update” function has IAM permissions to change the code of the function we care about. When a JAR file is placed in the S3 bucket, a SNS notification calls the update function (based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/s3_bucket_notification.html#add-notification-configuration-to-lambda-function&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; Terraform example.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have mixed feelings. This might work and never need touching again—or have unexpected problems that are hard to investigate because so many of Amazon’s services (e.g., IAM) are black boxes and don’t log their decision-making. I prefer systems where things are more explicit, because how they work can be investigated and rediscovered. But this will teach us something, and I hope I can put in place testing to highlight &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is broken if things break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bringing-more-of-myself-to-work&quot;&gt;Bringing more of myself to work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my own time I’ve been trying to bring more of myself to work, and act less. Not pretending happiness when unhappy is a bit scary around other people, but gosh it’s relieving. I resorted to a guide of &lt;a href=&quot;https://worddreams.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/how-to-show-not-tell-an-emotion-a-to-d/&quot;&gt;how to show emotions&lt;/a&gt; to figure out healthy ways to express myself without causing problems for others. It seems to be going well—next week I hope to find a way to ask for feedback about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week will be quite interesting. I’m shadowing a Delivery Manager; hoping to learn more about what they do, how it might suit me, and how to protect my own energy better. Given that this infrastructure relies on events happening as expected, I also hope to put in place some automated testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">This was a short week.

And I’ve contributed a lot back to my team from that. But after 10 months I needed to get some wider context, and see how other teams work. To that end I’m helping a product team deploy its infrastructure for private beta.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent last week starting to understand my new team’s culture and mission, investigating the project I’m helping deploy, researching ways of packaging Java/JVM projects for release (e.g., fat JARs), and arranging community things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/Queer-Code-London/&quot;&gt;Queer Code London&lt;/a&gt; need a new venue for their Saturday lunchtime coding events, and I’ve been checking that we’re OK to host it in the GDS office. (We can!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to leaving drinks for Dan and Graham, both of whom were on the PaaS team when I first joined. A bit sad—both were fantastic to work with—and yet lovely to see such experienced people finding new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned from my time on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk&quot;&gt;GOV.UK PaaS&lt;/a&gt; team that structured summary notes are incredibly valuable, so I condensed a lot of historical experimentation into some Markdown notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to get this project running on the PaaS, my old team’s Cloud Foundry platform, but it didn’t work because the file layout is very odd. There’s a lot of external policy we have to work with, limiting what we can change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after that I changed my approach. I’m only helping this team for a few weeks, so I shouldn’t try to Get Things Done or directly make problems disappear. Instead I’ll act like a mentor, boosting the team’s own confidence with infrastructure. This process has a learning curve for me but is less pressure and quite enjoyable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got upset this week, having left my familiar team and feeling a bit out of place in the Ops community. I haven’t observed the group dynamics enough to understand why it’s so male, and the last year has taught me to be careful about investing my energy in culture problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever the small, lunchtime Meditation Club got me through the week. Having people about me for reassurance and wellbeing skills is an utter joy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Since joining GDS I’ve learned a lot about infrastructure and ways of working like agile and XP.

The frontend, things like accessibility and JavaScript, felt like novelties.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That single codebase &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; the website. It received web requests directly from its users, it talked directly to the database that stored the website’s state, it decided all the business logic of how the website worked, and it rendered HTML to be sent back to the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots has changed. Some of this might be about the quality of environments I’m working in, but I don’t think very much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-quality&quot;&gt;Code quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, most of the code I saw from other programmers embedded SQL queries directly into HTML templates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-php highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;A website&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Visitor count: &lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mysql_exec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;INSERT INTO visitors (ip_address) VALUES (&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$_SERVER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'REMOTE_ADDR'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;);&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mysql_fetch_row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mysql_query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM visitors;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t run that code, but it’s quite typical of what freelance web developers were doing in the early 2000s. It rarely had proper error handling, rarely prevented SQL Injection, and almost never prevented XSS Injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a lot of feedback about how good I was at avoiding these problems, but I eventually decided that relying on my attention to detail to avoid these problems didn’t work. Hence I picked up MySQL query parameters to avoid SQL Injection, and eventually PHP frameworks like CodeIgniter to avoid XSS Injection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve come a long way in our tooling since then. Modern frameworks automatically escape data being output into HTML templates against XSS attacks. Modern frameworks often have an architecture that would make it inconvenient and difficult to embed database queries into HTML. Modern frameworks are often used with ORMs or other mechanisms that make SQL Injection much less likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this means you don’t have to think as much. Basic web application security and basic web application architecture is almost an automatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coupling-of-components&quot;&gt;Coupling of components&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I described how 2000s-era websites generally had one codebase for everything and deployed a single thing onto their webservers. This can work very happily when you first build a website, but it starts to have problems if you get a lot of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to change how data is stored, for instance to add caching around it, your first task becomes to abstract the data layer from the rest of your codebase. This could consume weeks of work without delivering any user value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the mid/late 2000s, mainstream frameworks started to separate the data layer out, for instance keeping it in the Models if following an MVC pattern. This meant that your changes only affect a more concentrated part of the codebase. But you ultimately still have one codebase and very little abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have marched on since then. These days you commonly deploy several components, rather than just one. You’ll have an API component that exposes ways to access your data but abstracts most of the details of how that’s done. You’ll have a backend component that performs business logic on data it gets and sets using the API. Then you’ll have a frontend component that directly interacts with user requests and talks to the backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won’t necessarily have all these components. You can achieve a lot of the benefits by keeping this pattern in mind at an early stage. But if you’re a microservices architecture like GOV.UK you have several data layer APIs, many backends, and then relatively few frontends. Separating these components keeps each piece small enough to be effectively worked on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;frontend-sophistication&quot;&gt;Frontend sophistication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over those 15 years, JavaScript has gotten a lot faster and a lot more capable. Web browser APIs have gotten a lot more featureful, offering 3D graphics and videocalls and many other things besides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User experience has gotten a lot better and a lot higher expectations (except for new weirdnesses like click-through cookie law banners.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started as more of a front-end developer, and then got to know the back-end as well. For many years I did freelance projects that were front-end, back-end or both and wouldn’t say I did one side better than the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think full-stack development has become less plausible. Expectations of user experience have gotten a lot higher, and the complexity of front-end development has exploded in a new search for the best ways of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge we seem to be left with is where business logic belongs. The frontend is nicest if you can make it a thin wrapper and push that onto the backend; the backend is nicest if you can make it a thin wrapper and push that onto the frontend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage I identify as a backend/operations person. I’m sure I’ll work heavily with the frontend again one day, but I don’t think I can do both any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-and-operational-sophistication&quot;&gt;Testing and operational sophistication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests used to be purely for your business logic. You’d test that your code calculated the correct prices. Deployment often meant FTPing your code onto a shared hosting environment. It was a mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have changed for the better. Source control is almost universal. Infrastructure has gotten more accessible to developers, which is a good thing for me. Testing of running/deploying websites is much more common.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-hasnt-changed&quot;&gt;What hasn’t changed?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very often we still want things to “just work!” But what things working look like is getting better and better, and that’s a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">When I started web development in the early 2000s, your typical medium sized website ran on a single codebase that ran in exactly the same way on a few webservers.

My first winter here has been just as lucky as
was my first in York, which is when I took this photograph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/uoy-cse-snowman.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;The base of a very large snowman being rolled into place outside University of York's Computer Science building&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in a city, I don’t drive and I rely on my feet, bicycles and public transport to get around.
Unless I need to cycle somewhere, I’m in the perfect position to enjoy and get excited by snow. And
I have! And it’s really pretty around here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/assets/stroud-green-crouch-end-snow.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/stroud-green-crouch-end-snow-small.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;A snow-covered vista from Stroud Green over Crouch End towards Alexandra Palace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I’d gotten lucky with a few days of snow in early December. I threw some snowballs,
admired dozens of snowpeople in Finsbury Park (no time to build one, sadly) and got to feel festive.
Getting another week of snow wasn’t something I hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a blizzard on my hill at times, watching snowflakes zoom down or snow from the ground
whipped up into the air. That’s been kind of cool, but also a little scary sometimes. Living in a
conservation zone is really nice in some ways, but old-fashioned sash windows really aren’t airtight
and I’ve had to improvise to seal up some holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a habit of visiting New England in December, a time of year when it gets awfully cold
weather and blizzards. Last December the wind chill one daygot down to about -22°C. Another day
I walked about six miles through half of a foot of snow from Cambridge, MA to Downtown Boston. That
day was when I took this next photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/cambridge-snowpeople.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; alt=&quot;A group of small snowpeople in Cambridge, MA last year&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven’t quite had that here yet but 4 days of snowing and a week of cold weather make me feel
like I’m there. It feels great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not the whole story. The cold giving us snow should be growing sea ice in the Arctic. We
might be having fun (unless you’re trapped on a train overnight!) but Polar Bears in the Arctic will
have less hunting territory. I don’t know how to change the vast problem that is reducing CO₂
emissions. We’re not willing to have lower living standards for it, especially when they’re already
eroding, even if there was a way to negotiate that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a tragedy and, whatever happens to human civilization, much of what made this world so amazing
will be changed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It’s been quite the Winter for snow in North London.

That’s when I moved to London, which has been really hard for me. So much change. Not being in York. Not being a student.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not like being in York was always easy. I got quite horribly traumatised. I went through a lot of therapy. I took 6 years to finish a 4 year degree–even if I spent 18 months of that leading the tech side of a startup, 6 months processing archaeological data, helped run half a dozen societies, wrote articles analysing representation in student government, helped build an amateur dramatic set, etc. But York was what I knew, and I’d learned to be happy there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in a large, flat team (now ~20 people) is nice–but a definite stressor for me. I’ve found my communication skills challenged in lots of new ways. Lots of new situations that I had to understand and adapt to. Lots of different ways of life–meeting people in somewhat different life situations, with different needs and points of view. Enjoyable, but challenging in a way I don’t think most people understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a related note, I chased an assessment letter from York and am finally coming to terms with some things about myself and why communication might be hard. I’m trying not to self-censor here. It’s hard. Give me time. Okay. I’m autistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of the work I’ve delivered, I’m quite happy. I lacked a lot of career direction as I finished my MEng. I’ve done so much web development between 11 and 24 that I find it relatively uninteresting. Joining GDS I’d hoped to find a very different (but in a good way) environment to the small organisations I’ve thrived in before now. By luck (or because I was fiddling with implementing distributed hash tables in my spare time) I’ve ended up working on the GOV.UK PaaS. While my job title is Developer, I felt very much like my first three months were being retrained in Ops. It’s not that I couldn’t do opsy things before, but it’s learning how to make responsible decisions in a somewhat different context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m having to slowly form a new life in London. It’s an opportunity: new communities more relevant to who I am now, like an LGBTQ choir I went to the other day. But it’s also quite frightening. I went back to University because there were lots of people at a time in their life where they’re quite available, and hundreds of societies, and yet the Uni degree as some structure. Non-Uni life isn’t quite like that. But I’ve found a room in a lovely flat near Finsbury Park, near some nice walks, and I’m hoping to be very happy in time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I haven’t posted here in 5 months.

I can’t believe this trip is nearly over - I fly home from Prague a little before 9pm on Day 12.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;alexanderplatz-and-the-pergamon-museum&quot;&gt;Alexanderplatz and the Pergamon Museum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The natural starting point for a day walking across the centre of Berlin seemed to be Alexanderplatz. It is a large area with monumental buildings, which leads on to Museum Island (see below) and the rest of Central Berlin. The highly-recognisable Berlin TV Tower is here, as is a Rotes Rathaus (a building I’ve seen in City Simulation games for many years with knowing where it was.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-tv-tower.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-alexanderplatz-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detailing on this church seems similar to &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/amsterdam-to-hannover/&quot;&gt;the Old City Hall in Hannover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-alexanderplatz-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berlin’s Museum Island has a remarkable concentration of excellent museums. I feel that I could spend a week looking through them, easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-museum-island-cathedral.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[MUSEUM ISLAND PICTURES]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to the Pergamon Museum, which exhibits major reconstructions of large ancient structures. It’s really rather impressive but the context of the structures isn’t introduced very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-pergamon-ishtar-wall.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-pergamon-roman-gate.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t even try to get great photos of these. They’re too large relative to the rooms to be easily photographed, and the ceiling lets in too much light to avoid glare. See Google or go to the Museum for yourself! Similar to the British Museum they have smaller artifacts as well, some of them plaster casts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-pergamon-lions.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-pergamon-figure.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hotel is around the corner from a large Muslim community centre, which was a reminder of how little I know about Islam and its cultural history. I wandered around an exhibit on Islamic Art at The Pergamon until my feet got tired, but I did find an amazing work that I believe is a vase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-pergamon-islamic-art-jug-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-pergamon-islamic-art-jug-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brandenburg-gate-holocaust-memorial-and-checkpoint-charlie&quot;&gt;Brandenburg Gate, Holocaust Memorial and Checkpoint Charlie&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the rest of the day I visited Gendarmenmarkt, the Brandenburg Gate, the Holocaust Memorial and Checkpoint Charlie. I must confess that this is presented a little out-of-order: I skipped Gendarmenmarkt at first, only to later realise that it would have been the area to stop for lunch, and headed back there for dinner later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-gendarmenmarkt-3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gendarmenmarkt is a large square with several magnificent large buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-gendarmenmarkt-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-gendarmenmarkt-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little further West, the area of the Brandenburg Gate reminds me of Trafalgar Square. Both are concretey urban and have impressive stonework, but I feel both somehow fail to justify their apparent tourist appeal. The area does have some things of interest - notably the Reichstag and the edge of Tiergarten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-brandenburg-gate.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-brandenburg-gate-interior.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few minutes south is The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe (more commonly known as The Holocaust Memorial.) On the surface this consists of supernumerary concrete blocks set out in a disturbing, undulating grid pattern. Underneath is a Holocaust Museum that wasn’t open today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-holocaust-memorial.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checkpoint Charlie was the main crossing point between West and East Berlin for much of the Cold War. As with much of Berlin the area has been completely redeveloped since, and all that remains of what was once there is the little hut in the middle of the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-checkpoint-charlie.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This area is quite the tourist trap and the Berlin Wall places to visit seem to be elsewhere. But there is remarkably detailed information for such a public site along a few walls on the roadside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;topography-of-terror&quot;&gt;Topography of Terror&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have the words to convey this experience, not without blubbering them out through pillows. This free collection of exhibits, on the site of the former SS headquarters, deconstructs how the Nazis built their terrible state and committed so many evils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-topography-of-terrors.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- There isn't much to say about this place. It's a detailed and haunting look at how the Nazis came to power, how they consolidated their control of the government, how they kept the populace on side, and how they pursued their terrible ends. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’ve ever been somewhere where every visitor was so silent or so close to tears. If not for children, footsteps and the occasional tourguide it might be nearly silent. It mixes evidence, pictures, personal accounts and higher-level information in a way that one can’t help but find haunting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m very glad I went. The information on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; they got the populace on side and how they &lt;em&gt;kept&lt;/em&gt; the populace on side through so many horrors is a valuable cautionary tale.

I’m here on the way to Berlin, visiting a more realistic, non-capital-city and yet thoroughly pleasant city. &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/amsterdam-to-hannover/&quot;&gt;Last night&lt;/a&gt; I wandered through much of the Old Town and down to the large Maschsee lake. Today I’m visiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrenhausen_Gardens&quot;&gt;The Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen&lt;/a&gt; and hopping back on a Deutsche Bahn ICE train to Berlin.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-royal-gardens-of-herrenhausen&quot;&gt;The Royal Gardens of Herrenhausen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gardens are divided into two areas, with half composed of short greenery and the other half of quite tall trees. The best way to show this is a satellite view, so please forgive the size of the Google Map below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;position:relative;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:90.05%;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d5965.481180443901!2d9.693881703646845!3d52.38798026606271!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x0%3A0x8aba2eb652d94572!2sHerrenhausen+Gardens!5e1!3m2!1sen!2sde!4v1498337882836&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make my 12:31pm train, I got there shortly after it opened at 9am. I seemed to be the second or third visitor of the day, which was great for getting photos without people in them. Access was remarkably easy: Hannover’s main train station and main U-Bahn station are linked by a subterranean shopping mall, and from there it’s an 8 minute journey running every 7 minutes. If you visit, note that the fountains turn on from about 10am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-circlefountain.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-gardens-front-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statues guarding the front garden remind me of Weeping Angels from Doctor Who…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-gardens-front.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further back there are an assortment of smaller gardens, some with roses and others with more artistic bushes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-rose-garden.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-rose.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-little-garden.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rear garden is largely composed of trees. It has an incredibly tall waterfall, which Wikipedia claims can reach 80m high in calm weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-fountains.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started to rain at this point, so I tried hiding under a tree while putting on my anorak. This tree turned out be in the spray from the fountain, which was far worse than the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-fountain-spray.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The east and west in particular have beautiful geometry from long rows of trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-tree-row.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-tree-row-building.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The garden is encircled by a small canal. This ornate bridge presumably dates from the original construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-boundary-bridge.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original palace was destroyed in WWII. In the early 2000s it was rebuilt (below), and now houses a Museum that I didn’t get to visit - a shame, as I’d have loved to hear more of the history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-palace.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hannoverberlin&quot;&gt;Hannover–Berlin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have too much to report for the journey East to Berlin. It rained a lot, the architecture changed but not in a way I could pinpoint until Berlin, and I’m pretty tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/dull-near-hannover.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little later the rain had become quite intense, the entire window a waterfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rain-near-hannover.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things cleared up just in time to see a train carrying BMWs. I suppose it’s an efficient way to get them to port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/weather-cleared-near-berlin.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/car-transporter-near-berlin.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berlin Hauptbahnhof is somewhat more complicated (5 storeys all open plan) than I’d anticipated, and finding where tourist information was to buy a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.visitberlin.de/en/berlin-welcome-card&quot;&gt;Berlin Welcome Card&lt;/a&gt; (3 days of public transport and free/discounted attractions) took some doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-hauptbahnhof-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-hauptbahnhof-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I meant to do throughout this trip was to document the design of everyday buildings and objects. It’s too late to make a good study of that now, but here is the design of Deutsche Bahn departure signs and a U-Bahn station in eastern Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/hannover-db-sign.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/berlin-ubahn-station.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two full days to enjoy Berlin, and I’m rather fatigued. Thus I got dinner at a burger place outside the hotel (&lt;em&gt;hallo! ich möchte einen Cheeseburger und Süßkartoffelpommes, bitte&lt;/em&gt;), napped for awhile and then read up on what to do in Berlin. Bye for now!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Yesterday I got to Hannover, Germany.
