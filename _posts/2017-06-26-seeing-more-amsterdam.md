title: 'Day 6: Seeing more of Amsterdam'

[On Day 5](/2017/amsterdam-tulips-pancakes/) I saw the Tulip Museum and Body Worlds, had pancakes, rode the tram and wandered a bit. For a few hours I'd considered staying an extra day in Amsterdam, spending most of it sunbathing in Vondelpark, and skipping Hannover. But then the 30°C weather broke and that option became relatively less appealing. Thus today is my last day here, and I wanted to round it out by learning a bit more about Amsterdam itself.

Amsterdam has a lot of sides to it. You could spend a partyish few days smoking weed, partying, walking through the Red Light District and (presumably not in that district) trying to get laid - but, to be honest, that only sounds fun when bringing friends along. You could spend a painful few days visiting the Anne Frank Museum and the like - but I'm mostly leaving that part of history until Berlin. You could spend a chill few days enjoying the architecture, parks, history, museums - and that's largely what I've done.

I started out by visiting the Amsterdam Museum, with permanent exhibits on Amsterdam's history (independence from Spain, the Golden Age, the building of the canal layout, the Nazi Occupation and 60s/70s counterculture) and temporary exhibits on fascinating bits of culture (.)

I'm really quite proud of how I've dressed so far this trip. I've been overweight for a long time, which naturally means a degree of body image problems. But this trip I've been wearing short-sleeves and shorts and it's been great. It is no longer 35°C outside but 24°C is easily sufficient.

After reading a bit about drug legalisation in The Netherlands, I wanted to follow a tip from The Guardian and [get some frites.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/20/chips-are-down-for-belgian-frites-as-eu-acts-on-chemical) They were indeed very gorgeous, especially with some sort of mayonaise that I picked at random off a list in Dutch.

I've walked a very long way every day of this trip so far. My feet hurt. Thus I needed something to do sitting down. By pure chance, Amsterdam is a city with canals whose view of the city beats that of the streets. So I went on a canal tour, for €11.

I came across the side of a canal being rebuilt, which I found quite interesting even if it was difficult to see well.

Heading East towards Berlin and Prague, I think I might read the Diary of Anne Frank. I need a new book to read and while I haven't managed to visit this trip I certainly would in future - just make sure to [book ahead](http://www.annefrank.org) first!
