I handed in my dissertation two weeks ago. There's a few things to finish up but the major things I've wanted to deliver this year - a cryptanalysis report, an evolutionary computing experiment, my video processing dissertation - are all done. So from my perspective I'm pretty much done and awaiting Graduation come July!

The Masters year was exhausting and I'm a little burned out, so I'm hoping not to rush into anything. I've wanted to go travelling in Europe for a few years now but kept finding interesting internships instead. Now between University and what-comes-after I have a natural gap.

Friends, culture and history put Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Greece on the list. I'd like to follow Archaeological data I worked with into the Troodos Mountains in Cyprus, but that would be a trip in itself.

That quote above is one a friend sent me. They're moving back to east Asia, away from the friends they've made here in York and back to a different culture. I sympathise in my own way: I grew up in an isolated village and adopted York as my hometown.

Over these six years London, Hamburg, the San Francisco Bay Area, Cambridge, MA and a few other cities in the U.S. have gained wonderful memories as well. This shows I don't have to worry, and yet the Plath quote remains.

I've chatted with a lot of people about what to do next. It needs to be a step up, and yet it's hard to know what a step up from effective-CTO of a technically hard startup would be. Delivering in a larger organisation? "Cross-functional agile teams?" Engineering technically-harder things? Making better startup decisions the second time around?

I'm gonna find out.

End of the day, it just has to be rewarding and worthwhile while either paying the bills or working around them.

The UK has taken a disturbing turn in the last year, and I don't quite know what it means for my or our future.

If I want to focus on engineering I'd like to work with Distributed Systems at an organisation that does good. If I want to mix product and engineering I'd either look at Product Manager or head back into startups. If I want to

head back into startups I have a choice of doing my own - Dreamforge taught me a lot about the early-stage - or finding a team and direction I like.
