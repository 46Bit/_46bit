I mused about an implementation of expression trees in Rust [two days ago](https://46b.it/2017/rust-generating-syntax-trees/). This is to build a Genetic Programming library in Rust - an biologically-inspired approach to finding robust solutions to difficult problems.

As discussed elsewhere I've become a keen fan of Rust. This language's limited generics pose interesting problems for expressing and generating equations as described above.

There are two common ways to represent a tree datastructure:
<!--more-->

* The most obvious way is similar to a Linked List: allocate a separate portion of memory for each node in the tree and store pointers to the child/parent nodes. This makes it cheap to expand the tree and is a very natural representation.
* The other way is to put the tree into an array. Map the parent-child relationships into indices and you can store a tree as a single block of memory. Adding nodes can require copying all this data into a larger region of memory but this has a variety of benefits such as cache locality.

We can define the semantics of a heap-allocated expression tree at compile time. Here's a cut-down example - you can get and play with the [full code here](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=ddbde8dbeacb4f501995aef551f5ac7f&version=stable&backtrace=0).

``` rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq)]
enum Equation {
    Add(Node<Equation>, Node<Equation>), // `a + b`
    Sub(Node<Equation>, Node<Equation>), // `a - b`
    Mul(Node<Equation>, Node<Equation>), // `a * b`
    Div(Node<Equation>, Node<Equation>), // `a / b`
    Neg(Node<Equation>), // `-a`
    Sin(Node<Equation>), // `sin(a)`
    Float(f64), // evaluates to a constant 64-bit float
    Input, // evaluates to an inputted 64-bit float
}

impl Equation {
    fn eval(&self, env: &Self::Environment) -> Self::Action {
        match *self {
            Add(ref left, ref right) => left.eval(env) + right.eval(env),
            Sub(ref left, ref right) => left.eval(env) - right.eval(env),
            Mul(ref left, ref right) => left.eval(env) * right.eval(env),
            Div(ref left, ref right) => protected_div(left.eval(env), right.eval(env)),
            Neg(ref left) => -left.eval(env),
            Sin(ref left) => left.eval(env).sin(),
            Float(i) => i,
            Input => *env,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // represent the equation `x` and evaluate for `x=5`
    let tree1 = Equation::Input;
    println!("{:?}", tree1.eval(5.0));

    // represent the equation `x * sin(4.0)` and evaluate for `x=-7.3`
    let tree2 =
      Equation::Mul(
        node(Equation::Input),
        node(Equation::Sin(
          node(Equation::Float(4.0))
        ))
      );
    println!("{:?}", tree2.eval(-7.3));

    // represent the equation `x + sin(x)` and evaluate for `x=99.1` and `x=16.3`
    let tree3 =
      Equation::Add(
        node(Equation::Input),
        node(Equation::Sin(
          node(Equation::Input)
        ))
      );
    println!("{:?}", tree3.eval(99.1), tree3.eval(16.3));
}
```

This works for Genetic Programming and I've devised nice ways to randomly generate these trees - see the [Symbolic Regression example](https://github.com/46bit/evco/blob/master/examples/symbolic_regression.rs) and (this might not be obvious) [`evco::gp::tree`](https://46bit.github.io/evco/evco/gp/tree/index.html).

However this does limit flexibility. Using a generic tree datastructure would allow for easily introducing or removing sorts of nodes at compile time. I found that in DEAP this sort of flexibility helped for experimenting but tended not to stick around, so it might well be better.

*That's all for now, it's time for bed. Sometime soon I'd like to write about [diversity experiences in tech](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/01/silicon-valley-sexual-harassment-startups), and how EVCO generates trees.*
