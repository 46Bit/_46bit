title: Your Controversy makes me cringe
---
It seems every other week that some community or other is in turmoil over a critical piece of writing. Minor matters turn into major rifts and (in the case of many large communities) socialites lap it all up and stir the pot. The problem is that most of the time, nobody really means ill.

Consider for a moment that you're accosted on the street by an acquaintance. You are then subjected to several minutes of discussion of the points that they feel are most problematic with your latest work, before they walk away without giving you a chance to take it in and respond.

Thus it is with most extended critiques online. A well-meaning blogger writes a few hundred words covering almost all of their concerns. This then gets forwarded to the person it was largely aimed at - and quite consistently, misunderstood.

Being text, the subtle signals in face-to-face conversation are missing. As such every badly-written suggestion becomes an insult and every minor criticism becomes vitriolic. Neither sarcasm or mood convey well in text, so a subtle joke becomes inane and critical babbling.

People aren't good at taking in masses of text. It's far too hard to take in a plethora of subtle points, especially when most are more concepts than actionable ideas. You're far better off starting a private email thread back and forth, consisting of [short emails](http://five.sentenc.es) covering things sequentially. There's less scope for misunderstanding, negligible chance of information overload and an ability to just Shut Up if your advice isn't welcome.

I concluded this right around when I got fed up of upsetting the applecart at school. It's not easy to stick to this mindset, although at times it makes you want to scream when people seem to have forgotten it.
