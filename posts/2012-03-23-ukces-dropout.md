title: UKCES Hack
---
It's been a while since I mentioned much about what I'm actually up to, so with a [hackday](http://rewiredstate.org/events/ukces-db-hack) for the UK Commission on Employment & Skills earlier this week it was a great opportunity to publicly play with a crazy idea.

The aim of the database we were using was to help people make more informed decisions. However one trend as of late is people being encouraged to get a degree just to have one: rather than as something to help them or even something to interest them. Hence my rather tangential aim was to encourage people to think honestly about what's *really right for them*.

So as any self-respecting hacker would, I built a site to **jokingly** encourage college dropouts. Using real vacancy & pay data. Despite the hidden jibe, it was a joint winner. So for your amusement may I present "**[Dropout Or Not](http://dropoutornot.com)**".

(*Obviously this is a joke.* If it's time for you to drop out then you'll probably have realised that already. Don't decide based on what my 4-hour hack tells you. Think for yourself. That's hopefully enough of a disclaimer.)

*Updated 17/05/2012 to reflect renaming from 'Should I Drop Out?' to 'Dropout Or Not'.*
