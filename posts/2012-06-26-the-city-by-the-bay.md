title: The City by the Bay
---
I've only been in San Francisco since Thursday, yet within about 36 hours I couldn't imagine being anywhere else. It manages to have the slight impracticality of Durham, the adorable charm of York or Oxford, a computer technology buzz to shame Silicon Roundabout (not difficult&hellip;) and that distinctive visual charm that I really can't express in terms of any other city I know.

I'm staying in a lovely apartment west of Russian Hill. Being just off Union Street there's cafes, restaurants, shops and banks within a couple of blocks &amp; more than a few convenient Muni (bus) lines to Downtown, the Golden Gate, Marina and almost anywhere else as well.

My Muni route into the city centre passes through North Beach (*Little Italy*) and Chinatown, so I've sometimes been get the bus up Russian Hill and then walk most of the rest of the way. Both are pretty awesome in their own right - and certainly make for a slightly more entertaining bus ride even if I am feeling lazy.

I've a long time to explore everything rather than having to rush like your typical tourist - all the way until mid-September in fact. I'm rather stocked up on books to read and things to learn (including up-to-4-years of Computer Science notes).

After a rather Tic-Tac filled flight (don't ask), Thursday largely consisted catching up with [some good friends](https://twitter.com/46Bit/status/215960138572496896). Despite surprisingly mind jet-lag I collapsed into sleep by about 11pm.

After regaining consciousness, where else to go on your first full day in San Francisco but to walk across the Golden Gate Bridge? As with so many things, it's far more impressive in person that pictures convey - although on a tangental note, I'm rather disappointed to see that the [BART](http://www.bart.gov) trains resemble Epcot on the outside only.

  <p>Being the San Francisco Bay it was always going to be foggy or cloudy, although it did clear later on.</p>

After the bridge, I headed over to Market Street for lunch and some reading up on Game Theory - a brilliant field for reasoning about logical situations in established notation. I've been reading a [Very Short Introduction](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0199218463) to Game Theory, with another 3 such books queued up behind it.

Whilst I've done way too much to dive into, other notable moments include discovering a [superb place for burgers](http://superdupersf.com), a journey back from Palo Alto which took 3&times; as long as expected and last but not least a visit to the Palace Of Fine Arts.

If you gave someone a pretty hefty budget and told them to design a park to endear itself to those with a major fetish for Neoclassical Architecture (read: *me*) then you'd get something like the Palace Of Fine Arts. I visited when the [Exploratorium](http://www.exploratorium.edu) (that's like Eureka for anyone British) was closed, but being just a 20-minute walk I should think I'll go there tomorrow.

On the hacking side of things I've been finishing off a few projects before getting going on a raft of new public ones. As well as neat coding projects, a second blog focusing on Commercial Space is on the cards. You'll be hearing about that within two weeks now.

A brilliant first 6 days in San Francisco all round. After this first week it's off to the Mission, then quite possibly South towards Palo Alto if a few things work out.
