title: The Curse of Contemplation
---
<p>I need to think about things less. Whether it&#8217;s a curious maths trick or a facet of architecture in York, I&#8217;ll spend half an hour in contemplation and research on it more often than I might even realise myself. This gives me a rather wide and unpredictable general knowledge, but it doesn&#8217;t really help.</p>

<p>As a technology person, my life and interests are roughly towards the same. I&#8217;m not necessarily a web person, or even a software person: being 18 and at University, my biography has yet to finish the first chapter. I&#8217;m looking at where I am and where I want to make, but I&#8217;m not really there yet.</p>

<p>For now though, my interests are best served by focusing on software. Learning about standardisation of Roman Fortresses might be fascinating, but it makes it harder to focus on the here and now. I need specific goals that advance me as a person.</p>

<p>Not to mention how much of undirected thought leads to depressing places. The West seems to be indebted and directionless, in self-destructive wars with informal groups of terrorists whilst our real competitors in the East receive no challenge. It&#8217;s perfectly true from what I study and assert, but it also doesn&#8217;t do a good job of making me live my life happily.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m as yet undecided whether this is me giving up on being what you might call a Renaissance Man. The world here and that once was still fascinates me and always will, but I need to live for the here and now. Innovative and changeful thinking requires you to study elsewhere, but perhaps there&#8217;s a time and place where it belongs instead of everywhere.</p>
