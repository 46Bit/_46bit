title: Accelerating Soil topology processing with GPUs
description: I've been living on my own (or rather in shared houses) for a few years now and I've finally got to the point of wanting a bit more interesting decoration. One of the fascinating things about growing up in the foothills of the Pennine hills is that you're surrounded by river valleys too large to really grasp, and settlements that often grew haphazardly around or above them. I've been building Soil, an online store for models of your favourite regions on Earth using public topology data.
