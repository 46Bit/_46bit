title: Of Tricorders and Starships

Any *Star Trek* fan has probably noticed the parallels between the iPhone<sup><a href="/2012/08/08/of-tricorders-and-starships/#of-tricorders-and-starships-ref-1" id="of-tricorders-and-starships-ref-1-location">[1]</a></sup> and the handheld [Tricorders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricorder) and pads of Trek. What's important to note is that whilst the events revolved about idealistic exploration using starships, the character development was a major focus.

I find an interesting contrast between how we're only now taking tiny steps towards serious space industry, whilst the market for high-tech gadgetry has been booming for close to a decade now.

Whilst building a starship like the Enterprise is beyond us, we've instead turned to developing the cultural tools that we can make an attempt at. If you watch a few episodes, you rapidly realise that the characters see the world through their Tricorders - just as we increasingly rely on our devices to [navigate](https://maps.google.com), [communicate](https://twitter.com) and [learn](http://en.wikipedia.org).

You may wonder whether in hindsight we could have guessed this was going to happen. I say the answer is yes. If you consider the handhelds, all that was needed to implement them in the show was to design the interfaces and create some mockups. Thus when engineers were inspired to spend their lives building this stuff, this was the problem they would end up solving. To build the spacecraft would take far more knowledge, time and effort than we could possibly manage right now. Let alone to do it within a lifetime.


For the handhelds all that was needed was to design some tactile interfaces. For the ships, a huge amount of science-fiction needed to be dreamt up for it to be acceptable to an audience.

Things do come full circle however: the miniaturisation that has become affordable through the handheld revolution is giving projects like [CubeSat](http://www.cubesat.org) a chance to do some incredible things. Meanwhile the nascent 3D printing industry may give us some of the [flexibility and freedom](http://dreamforge.me/beliefs.html) of Replicators.

We'll probably never build a Warp engine<sup><a href="/2012/08/08/of-tricorders-and-starships/#of-tricorders-and-starships-ref-2" id="of-tricorders-and-starships-ref-2-location">[2]</a></sup>, but we should manage to start extracting resources from the asteroids within only a couple of decades.

## Footnotes
<sup><a href="#of-tricorders-and-starships-ref-1-location" id="of-tricorders-and-starships-ref-1">[1]</a></sup> I generally use "iPhone" to refer to everything from mobiles to tablets that has got it right and come afterwards. Apple's trademark lawyers might hate me for it though.

<sup><a href="#of-tricorders-and-starships-ref-2-location" id="of-tricorders-and-starships-ref-2">[2]</a></sup> Faster-than-light travel may well always be impossible or impractical. There's incredible problems with taking advantage of a Warp field even if you've got one, notably getting torn to shreds by interstellar Hydrogen.
