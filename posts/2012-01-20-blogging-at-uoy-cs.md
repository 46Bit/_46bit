title: A few months as a York Computer Science student
---
As an undergrad student I was asked to start blogging for my Computer Science department at the University of York. My first post on what I've been up to in the last few months has just been published.

Hi! I'm Michael Mokrysz - a first-year studying the MEng Computer Systems & Software Engineering course. Having been asked to post a bit on my experiences at York I should probably start by introducing myself. After getting started with computers in a big way when I was around 11, I've spent the intervening years specialising in web development.

I'm a regular at <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/" target="_blank">Hackdays</a> & <a href="http://barcamp.org/w/page/402984/FrontPage" target="_blank">Barcamps</a> (casual tech gatherings where attendees gives the talks) and probably spend far too much time with computers instead of ordinary people ... if such a thing is possible. I'm also planning on interning in San Francisco this summer. You can find me on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/46Bit" target="_blank">@46Bit</a>.

Being a few awesome months into my course now it seems sensible to try and address the things I'd have liked to have known before getting here. I probably saw at least 5 lists like this before arriving and gained a limited amount from them, but hopefully I'll do better.

Perhaps the largest shock (in a good way) to me was the change in environment from computer-lacking 6th Form/College to University. Despite my best efforts, my school never offered anything beyond basic Microsoft Office lessons whereas an environment that embraces Nerds is just as fantastic as I'd hoped. All of a sudden those hours I spent trying to learn how to build Compilers despite lacking the requisite knowledge are actually starting to help out.

(Incidentally, for any of you with an interest in fixing the Computer curriculum in schools I'd suggest getting involved in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/coding-for-kids" target="_blank">Coding For Kids</a>. Especially after Michael Gove's well-publicised announcement of scrapping a set IT curriculum it's quite likely that changes are afoot. Also if you're free this August then consider attending <a href="http://youngrewiredstate.org/" target="_blank">Young Rewired State</a> - it's an amazing week of building apps/visualisations with public data or anything else that comes to mind. I'm not joking when I say it made me who I am today.)

Another interesting lesson I've learned is that immediate impressions of modules can be misleading. For instance <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/undergraduate/modules/hacs.html">HACS</a> is a Human-Computer Interaction module in the first term. It's unquestionably useful stuff to build software that people can actually understand, yet the main thing I gained from it was a greater appreciation for casually reading research papers. Before starting I didn't really expect to enjoy it quite so much.

A final recommendation: get a bicycle. Being on the main campus yet getting to morning lectures in 9 minutes is brilliant for getting some extra sleep. Although I should mention, for any of you considering using it to let you stay out even later, that <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/35-36/94/section/12" target="_blank">drunk cycling really is a crime</a>.
