title: Users want the tools of Hackers
---
Since starting at <a href="http://cs.york.ac.uk">York</a>, I&#8217;ve made heavy use of Google Docs for group assignments. The baked-as-standard version control and collaboration make it invaluable[1]. Whilst doing this, I&#8217;ve grown to realise that Google Docs is merely giving the tools of hackers to the public.

When writing my Personal Statement for applying to University, I used Git for versioning and Github for backup[2]. The text was set in Word and later Markdown once I&#8217;d seen sense about writing a plain-text document in anything not. This setup parallels much of what makes Google Docs so brilliant. It&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s a huge improvement, but that it brings casual users the hacker way.

Casual users commonly have the same problems as hackers, and yet they don&#8217;t get our solutions until someone fixes that. This scenario is true of Google Docs, Dropbox for file storage and Skype for communication. There&#8217;s money to be made in expanding a niche solution. If your Startup problem really exists, it has probably already been solved in a hardcore group.

My summer at <a href="http://snapshotmedia.co.uk">Snapshot Media</a> convinced me that features mean little, and what matters is enabling your users. If you give someone a bunch of buttons to press, they&#8217;ll play with them (often creating monstrous results that look fancy but, well, suck). If you give them a tool for purely Getting Things Done nicely, they&#8217;ll write the document quicker and move on feeling satisfied.

This is why I think LaTeX is the precursor to what kills Word Processing. After a few decades, people get bored of fancy colours and messy layouts. What really matters is content that is tolerable and readable. LaTeX is our solution to this and with luck, a hacker is on the road to the general solution already. As for what happens to Microsoft&#8217;s cash cow when they succeed (even if Google Docs hasn&#8217;t killed it by then), the writing is on the wall.
