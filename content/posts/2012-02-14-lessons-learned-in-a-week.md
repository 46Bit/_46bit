title: Lessons learned in a week
---
As part of a 'study skills' module here at York, we were recently asked to consider a Randy Pausch [lecture on Time Management](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blaK_tB_KQA). One of the things which I latched onto was not the lecture but rather in the email introducing it:

> "I promise you that the hour you spend watching this video will gain you several hours by the end of the month, perhaps by the end of the week. But this won't happen if you just play the video in the background while you do something else. Rather, you should pay close attention and take notes and think about what he says."
> &mdash; <cite>[Alan Frisch](http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~frisch/)</cite>

This sort of prolonged attention doesn't come easily to me. The volume of knowledge now available is such that it is an act of wilful ignorance to not know at least the surface facts on every topic. As such you can't expect to magically avoid distractions. 'Learning' is addictive.

When racing to meet a deadline, distractions often get entirely overlooked - essentially this is the same as being *In The Zone*. You need to be more interested in what you're doing than in reading about an [under-appreciated aspect of WWII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War)<sup><a href="#on-inertial-burnout-ref2" name="on-inertial-burnout-loc2">[1]</a></sup>. If needs be, take a break and come back refreshed in 10 minutes. In this thinking I am undoubtedly influenced heavily by the aforementioned talk. My previous [terribly-written essay](/2011/11/curse-of-contemplation/) was certainly far less decisive.

Perhaps the greatest message the lecture gave was to truly value time. I've long considered valuing my general time (rather than specifics like freelance work) an impossible task. Yet if you're not getting your time valued then you need to step up and move yourself from that situation. You can *always* change things.

> "I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?' And whenever the answer has been 'No' for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something."
> &mdash; <cite>[Steve Jobs, Stanford Commencement Address 2005](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA)</cite>

Those of you who know me outside hackdays likely know I've been struggling with stress lately. Yet it's not so much about an overload of tasks because there is too little time (although that was certainly a factor), but rather that I've kept rethinking decisions and not moving on - as Randy Pausch [describes it](http://youtu.be/blaK_tB_KQA?t=1h3m25s), hoping to 'get lucky'. Last week essentially consisted of me trying to fix that.

The wish to learn lessons from this in the long run has led me to build a [reminder](/dont-panic/). Provided I don't feel like being a fool it'll still be part of my homepage next year.

### Footnotes
Although he passed away in 2008, another lecture on achieving your dreams by Andy Pausch is also well worth 93 of your minutes: [The Last Lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo).

<a href="#on-inertial-burnout-loc2" name="on-inertial-burnout-ref2">[1]</a> If you read more than a few sentences of that page then I've failed to interest you. I know that from recent experience.
