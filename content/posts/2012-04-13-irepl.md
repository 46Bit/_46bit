A couple of months ago, whilst playing with Messages Beta for Mac, it occured to me that it'd be a lot of fun to programmatically send messages. After I built a basic, insecure Ruby Shell for iMessage, [David Kendal](http://davidkendal.net) decided to rebuild it and switch to Scheme - for which a secure sandboxed version existed in the form of [Heist](https://github.com/jcoglan/heist).

After a fair bit of testing, bugfixing and building a quick instruction site, we [released iREPL](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3836195) today. My old Mac Mini is sat on a Wardrobe at the University Of York acting as the server for this.

**[Try iREPL out](http://irepl.im)** or take a look at the [source code](http://github.com/46Bit/irepl). I'm quite looking forward to seeing what else people come up with using it.
