title: National Hack The Government Day 2012
---
It is quite appropriate that an event dedicated to the power of Open Government should be held at that same Government's attempt to embrace the internet-focused future. Thus it is with the 4th National Hack The Government Day being held at the [Government Digital Service](https://www.gov.uk).

Hackdays are sporting events for the technically minded: sprints of programming websites, mobile apps and so forth to present - just for the sheer joy of creation. There's a fairly long (or short in government timescales) history of hacking open data, with this being the fourth annual National Hack The Government Day.

One of the main reasons for the interest in government data really comes down to what's not been done with it. It's all too easy to collect an interesting database and leave it lying around without any real practical usage, whereas when it's formatted nicely you can build [awesome things to actually help a *lot* of people](http://trains.im). This problem is a lot of what GDS and [Data.gov.uk](http://data.gov.uk) stand for solving.

NHTG is always one of the best [Rewired State](http://rewiredstate.org) events in terms of the hacks created and the variety of them. This year was [no exception](http://hacks.rewiredstate.org/events/nhtg12), funding energy efficiency [for the elderly](http://loftify.com), making a game out of [Government website costs](http://play-your-cards-right.herokuapp.com) and my own [Meals Off Wheels roadkill reporter](https://github.com/46Bit/mealsoffwheels).

As well as the GDS team for letting us <s>invade</s> <s>wreck</s> **occupy** their offices, a big hand should go to [Emma Mulqueeny](http://mulqueeny.wordpress.com), [Adam McGregor](https://twitter.com/adamamyl) and the entire Rewired State team. Despite trials, tribulations and [bad times](http://www.kernelmag.com/yiannopoulos/798/so-the-guardians-pro-developer-is-it/) the work they've done for the young coders of this country and for those older is immense. Worthy of a OBE, I've heard said before. For those of you who'll be in Britain this August, take a look at [Young Rewired State](http://youngrewiredstate.org/) - and if you've the cash, [donate to keep it going](http://www.peoplefund.it/young-rewired-state/)!

As for myself, having no idea when I'll next be at a Rewired State event, [#NHTG12](https://twitter.com/search/nhtg12) was a really great ending to a lengthy series of their awesome hackdays.
