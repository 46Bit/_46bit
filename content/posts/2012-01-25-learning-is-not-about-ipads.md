title: Learning is not about iPads
---
I suspect you will be familiar with the classroom video: typically a dreary tape teaching facts, with a veneer of 'fun' in attempt to make it interesting. Yet this has certain parallels with a range of modern educational technologies. Despite growing mania about putting <s>computers</s> iPads in classrooms there seems to be far less focus upon solving real educational problems.

You cannot force knowledge into a closed mind. Students learn when they *want* to learn. This is true whether the desire comes from natural interest, desire to succeed in exams (the typical model in modern formal education) or *enthusiasm gained from an inspiring teacher*.

When given a reasonable set of students it is ultimately the enthusiasm and talent of the teacher which determines the achievement of the majority of students. Intelligent students who have been encouraged to learn by their parents may well possess natural interest but these tend towards a minority.

Electronic whiteboards, computer programs and iPads can certainly make the process look innovative, yet this is at the cost of funnelling money into purchasing equipment instead of rewarding teachers and supplying plenty of *real* teaching aids.

Equipment like A4-sized student whiteboards actually does work for engaging a class and checking the content is being absorbed. In bulk it probably costs two orders of magnitude less than an iPad.

One area I would suggest reform is needed is far more in the realm of content than style. Rote learning of facts may give some measure of performance but ultimately you are not doing anything that a simple Prolog program couldn't do better.

As we move towards a truer knowledge economy, jobs increasingly will be found in tasks that computer automation cannot economically be used in. Notable examples include some programming, research and complex manual labour or social interaction (for example shop workers who aren't merely selling bandwidth). Schools are not entirely intended as funnels to the job market, but a complete disconnect is unwise.
