title: How do you write a good book for hackers?
---
Observing a shelf of programming books might suggest that they cover all you need to know. Surely a thick book and high price tag pays off with a larger benefit? Unfortunately it's not usually true. To the experienced reader they're actually far worse than you might think.

This has been bugging me for years - ever since trying to decide what to suggest for learning PHP. Looking through the "beginner" books I'd accumulated, my opinion was that most were unsuitable for anyone. The [only book that did make much sense](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0672329166) ultimately feels like a rewritten copy of the [PHP Manual](http://www.php.net/manual/en/preface.php), rather than a streamlined introduction for beginners<sup><a href="/2012/08/10/bad-books-on-programming/#ref1" id="ref1-location">[1]</a></sup>.

The ideal is a book with clearly defined breakpoints to experiment with what you've learned. The Pragmatic Programmers have got this one [nailed down brilliantly](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks) in many of their books. I do wonder if, when authors get this one wrong, it's because their chosen topic isn't that cracking.

Book length is a difficult issue as well. Some of the best books I've ever read have been as short as 40 pages, whilst others are far longer. It depends what the length is being used for: trading depth for breadth risks the reader outgrowing the book early on.

Given that I'm always tempted to cover too much in my essays, a series of shorter books is likely to work better than a single longer one. If you're a hacker looking to widen your skill set, [let me know](/contact/) what you'd like to learn. I'm looking to write for people who can already program, rather than true beginners.

## Footnotes

<sup><a href="/2012/08/10/bad-books-on-programming/#ref1-location" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup> Incidentally, I ended up recommending to work through the aforementioned [PHP Manual](http://www.php.net/manual/en/preface.php). Or try another language: the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com) are fantastic.
