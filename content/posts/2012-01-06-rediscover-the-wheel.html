title: Learning to Rediscover the wheel
---
<p>I didn&#8217;t like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. So one afternoon I hacked together a static-site generator called Fairytale. Comparatively it&#8217;s not as capable or well designed. Yet I can now appreciate why Jekyll works as it does despite my initial dislike.</p>
<p>This is an example of something of a personal rule: <strong>if you don&#8217;t understand something then build a simpler way to solve the problem</strong>. Crucially this isn't the same as building a clone: look for a sensible way to do things, not just the one that they chose.</p>
<p>In a similar way to how the creators of something are often amongst the greatest experts on using it, those who&#8217;ve fought with a problem are better placed to think intelligently about a solution.</p>
<p>In some ways this approach doesn&#8217;t help get stuff get done. After all it amounts to the opposite of &#8220;don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel&#8221;. Yet I've always felt that if trying to learn something new you can&#8217;t become an expert by just using what&#8217;s already been done. Using code libraries is a necessity for a productive programmer, yet you don&#8217;t learn much from it.</p>
<p>The more you do this the more you widen your knowledge. This time I&#8217;ve ended up using <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">HAML</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.ubuntuka.com/ubuntu-ramdisk-ramdrive-easy-way/">RAM Disk</a> just because they seemed interesting. From ORMs (&#8220;use only if necessary&#8221;) to personal hashing algorithms (&#8220;interesting but maybe not a good idea&#8221;) I&#8217;ve ended up reaching a lot of personal turning points just by doing &#8216;impractical&#8217; things.</p>
<p>As for Fairytale? You're reading the output right now, served from RAM disk.</p>
