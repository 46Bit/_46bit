title: Avoiding problems at a hackday
---
It's been surprisingly long since I last took part in a real hacking event, so this weekend I took the opportunity to attend Rewired State's [Parliament Hackday](http://rewiredstate.org/hacks/parliament-2012). This is my second time (and second tour of Parliament) in so many years.

Over the years I've built up a bunch of habits that prevent problems I've run into. I forgot quite a few of them today, and having remembered why they're so handy I felt detailing them for a wider audience might help others.

## Budget your time appropriately
The first thing to do when you've the beginnings of an idea is to **decide if it's achievable in the time available**. There's a lot of variability between a part-day and weekend hack in terms of what you can reasonably build, especially if there are constraints on what you're supposed to build.

One (paid) hackday I attended involved working with data in a incomplete API that nobody was previously familiar with. It was also overly short, given that **6 hours working with something very new can be quite limiting.** I only finished my joint-winning project, [Dropout Or Not](http://dropoutornot.com), because I had the idea when I arrived and hacked solidly for the first 5 hours.

If you're lucky and have something like 26 hours of hack time, you can build at least a working prototype of almost anything.

## Pay attention to your user interface
**If you're building something that you expect someone to use, it should seem reasonably usable.** Assuming you're building a web hack, one common option is to build on [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) so that you don't have to spend much time on styling the frontend.

Should you go with Bootstrap, I suggest using a theme like those from **[BootSwatch](http://bootswatch.com)** to make your webapp a little more memorable. **Nothing is more unwise, when judges are trying to remember 30 presentations, than looking identical to 60% of the other hacks.**

**If you choose to build your own interface, be careful of time.** I've messed up on this twice now, both at Parliament Hacks, ending up presenting a raw-looking hack almost entirely in grayscale. Unsurprisingly, I didn't win a prize.

## Switching to projector resolutions shouldn't a last-minute task
Far too many hackers get on stage with laptops at the wrong resolution for the projector, and the time wasted fiddling with it really adds up. **Conference organizers should always tell you in advance if the resolution is any different to `1024x768`.**

**Set your laptop resolution to what the projector uses at least 10 minutes before Show &amp; Tell begins.** Not giving sufficient time to check your interface works at a range of resolutions can end badly - and it's far easier to do than you might imagine.

Unless you're showing off more than a website, it's best to demo in full screen mode to eliminate distractions for both you and your audience.

## Demo your hack, not your Powerpoint skills
**People that present at a hackday using a Powerpoint presentation can drive me crazy**. There's only two common occasions when a slideshow beats a real demo:

* When you've not built much more than an interface.
* When you've been refining data to help other hackers, or similar circumstances where a pure demo would consist of scrolling down a JSON file.

Incidentally, **non-functional interfaces aren't necessarily a terrible thing**. If your skills are solely on the frontend and you've nobody to help you with the backend, building some concepts *that can be made to work* is nothing to feel too embarrassed about. Just please don't be an asshole pretending that it's fully functional: the other hackers in the room can usually tell all too easily.

## Try to overcome nervousness whilst presenting
Hackers in particular can be shy of being in the spotlight - I still am sometimes. Yet this really shouldn't affect demoing your hack. Everyone else demoing is probably as hesitant about the experience as you.

If you're lucky, a few people have gone before you and set the tone. I might not recommend going first if you aren't practiced with public speaking, since the reassurance of others having 'survived' before you can help.

There's also something of a life hack I've always done naturally, although I'm not sure if it will work for you. When doing public speaking, I tend to blur my eyes a little so that I don't really see the audience in detail - enough to see raised hands and facial expressions, but not enough to become distracted by. It also means you avoid eye contact, whilst still being able to look straight at the audience.

## Self-depreciation isn't your friend here

**It's very easy to dismiss your own hack as "just a quick bit of coding,"** in-so-doing hoping people will lose interest and not think badly of you. Don't do this, ever.

Most people in the audience aren't going to know how experienced you are at programming. Nor will they know what you do for a living. **Most of the cues people use to decide whether to appreciate a hack seem to come from your own behavior towards it.**

At the least you've probably spent 4 solid hours building your hack, taking decisions all the while. Talk about the decisions you made, and why you made them.

Self-depreciation in your demo is cowardice and does yourself a huge disservice. We can all get nervous, and every hackday presenter has been in the past.

## Need some inspiration for what to build?
Rewired State maintain lists of [what's been built](http://hacks.rewiredstate.org) at some of their past events, and there's a few of my past projects on [Github](https://github.com/46Bit). **Good luck!**
