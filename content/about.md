title: About
---

I'm a 21-year-old computer scientist with interests in [applied cryptography](https://github.com/46bit/pinocchio) and [computational geometry](https://github.com/46bit/soil). I'm a polyglot programmer and web developer, having [built](http://dreamforge.me) systems for designing 3D printable objects on the web during a year out.

I've won quite a few open data hackdays and created services like [UOY Bus](http://uoyb.us) and [iREPL](http://irepl.im). As a member of the [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org) I believe in internet freedom and strong civil liberties. I've an interest in the future path of humanity, encouraged by AI research and the [Long Now Foundation](http://longnow.org).

As a 2nd-year undergrad at [York](http://cs.york.ac.uk) I represent my year on department committees, organise outside sponsors and events for [HackSoc](http://hacksoc.org) and do publicity for [ShockSoc](https://www.facebook.com/ShockSoc). I also regularly raise eyebrows at [YUMS](http://yums.org.uk) by saying Math (without the s).

I grew up in West Yorkshire and plan to emigrate after graduating in 2016, probably to Germany or California.
