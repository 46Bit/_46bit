      <h3><a href="/2017/security-risk-assessment">I've been published!</a></h3>
      <p>In the last month I’ve published twice in our campus newspaper, Nouse:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.nouse.co.uk/2017/02/18/battle-of-the-colleges-whos-got-the-bnocs/">Battle of the colleges: who’s got the BNOCs</a>: I waited a year collecting data on candidates for our Student Union. This was some preliminary analysis with a second year of data - I only had 48 hours.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="http://www.nouse.co.uk/2017/03/07/yusu-elections-put-under-the-microscope-college-chances-campus-stances-and-gender-imbalances/">YUSU elections put under the microscope: college chances, campus stances and gender imbalances</a></strong>: our Student Union elections seem biased against underprovisioned Colleges and female candidates are running for much more junior positions.  <a href="/2017/writing-again">[&hellip;]</a></li>

      <h3><a href="/2017/security-risk-assessment">Security Risk Assessments of Semi-Autonomous Vehicles</a></h3>
      <p>I’m in my 4<sup>th</sup> year at York, the Masters year of my MEng Computer Science degree. This term I’ve taken the Topics in Privacy and Security (PSEC) module, which takes a wide technical swath through privacy and security issues. But the assessment is mostly focused on password cracking and doing a security risk assessment for automated road convoys.</p>
      <p>We’re assessing how to bring an EU-funded project, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_Road_Trains_for_the_Environment">SARTRE</a>, to market. The concept, “Safe Road Trains for the Environment,” allows an equipped car to automatically follow ~6m behind a Lead Vehicle. You could sit back and watch a movie—er, do productive work. <a href="/2017/security-risk-assessment">[&hellip;]</a></p>

      <h3><a href="/2017/bicycle-skid">Glad I was wearing a cycle helmet</a></h3>
      <p>One of my favourite things about York is how bicyclable it is. I grew up in the countryside but somewhere decidedly not safe to cycle from, so it’s a very welcome change. Aside from a couple of minor things it’s worked fine for the last 5 years. On Friday (<code>2017-03-10</code>) I had a bit of an accident.  <a href="/2017/bicycle-skid">[&hellip;]</a></p>
