* Further develop the arguments around Free Speech in ['I've been published'](/2017/writing-again/#i-argued-that-free-speech-arguments-are-being-used-out-of-confusion-or-even-bad-faith). In particular how it can be used to derail any serious debate or critique.
* Examine how I relate to concepts of social justice. In particular the gender balance of female engineers, my relationship with [SWEY](https://twitter.com/sweyork)/SWIS, and the [gender issues found around my Nouse articles](/2017/writing-again/#in-the-last-month-ive-published-twice-in-our-campus-newspaper-nouse).
  * Potentially approaches my own relation to gender/LGBTQ issues. Difficult subject but very rewarding if I can do it.
* Discuss [Nemil's posts and the mindset](https://www.nemil.com/musings/).
* What percentage of Britons can't afford an employment tribunal? Combine how many Brits can't afford a £1k unexpected expense with the new cost of an employment tribunal.
* Why didn't York vote Brexit/why did Yorkshire vote Brexit? Issues of cosmopolitanism, prosperity, hope and class will naturally abound.
* Your thoughts on Bobos in Paradise and The Preppy Handbook. Somewhat beyond what I know how to write, but I made a lot of notes on those books.
* [Information Avoidance paper](http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.20151245)
* [Ten Reasons People Resist Change](https://hbr.org/2012/09/ten-reasons-people-resist-chang)
* [Intellectual Humility](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13902710)
* [Technology is a marvel – now let’s make it moral](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/10/ethical-technology-women-britain-internet) [(thoughts)](https://twitter.com/46bit/status/851539265821577217)
