I've been reflecting this week on my career progress. I don't feel like years of experience is a useful number for me, because depending on how you qualify it I have either 15 (since I started coding), 9 (since my first paid work), 7 (since my first non-freelance work), 4 (the sum of my non-freelance work) or 2.5 (the sum of my non-freelance, non-internship work) years of experience.

On the technical front I've done front-end development, back-end development, systems development, and now web operations work at GDS—and I have serious commercial experience of each of those and more (the infrastructurey, web operations work being the newest.) Since joining GDS I learned how much I've been underselling this.

On the leadership/working-with-others front I'm not so sure. I've a long history of filling in for leadership vacuums, and of working in small teams where everyone was in charge. I've less experience of formally leading development teams, and none in such an agile environment as GDS. On the other hand, I contributed a lot to the culture of my previous team and found some ways to lead its delivery. I'm keen to get more experience with this.

Hmmm. What I wasn't isn't a promotion, what I want is a clear sense of career progression. I was a lead developer on a startup at 19. While I've been addressing my weaknesses there, I haven't had much more of a career direction other than trying out lots of technical fields (cybersecurity, geospatial, signal processing, infrastructure, …)
