Some years ago I participated in and won quite a few open data hackdays. This led to a front-page feature in [The Observer](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/mar/31/young-coders-ideas-for-change). Shortly after that I led development at a Y Combinator startup working on simple in-browser modelling for 3D Printing, such as with our early prototype [Cookie Caster](http://www.cookiecaster.com). Our former CEO [Nemil's blog](https://www.nemil.com/musings/) is a fantastic read.

After Dreamforge I took a bit of a break and went back to <a href="https://46b.it/wiki/york/">York</a> to finish my degree. There I helped run the [Swing Dance Society](http://www.yorkvision.co.uk/sport/spotlight-swing-dance-society/30/04/2014), [HackSoc](https://www.hacksoc.org/) and ShockSoc. I wrote a few data and analysis pieces for [Nouse](http://www.nouse.co.uk/2017/02/18/battle-of-the-colleges-whos-got-the-bnocs/), built a [campus bus aggregator](http://uoyb.us) and helped built a set for the amateur dramatic society. I also studied MEng Computer Science and got a 1st on a project extrapolating short videos and timelapses to predict the futureâ€¦ it was nearly as cool as it sounds.

As a member of the [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org), the [Long Now Foundation](http://longnow.org) and someone interested in [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org) I believe in internet freedom, strong civil liberties and sustainable growth. I'm concerned by [ongoing misrepresentation of free-speech](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1257833534308290&set=a.147155018709486.33009.100002449667634) and very much [favour increasing diversity in Software Engineering](https://sites.google.com/a/yusu.org/swey/).
