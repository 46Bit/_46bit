https://interrailplanner.com/blog/interrail-plan-insights-report-2017 and how stereotypical I was

Camera equipment: iPhone good enough for nearly everything for sake of blogging, but zoom camera proved really quite handy on Berlin-Prague and in future I'd keep it to hand on any train to access shots which contain less railway

Writing process: original plan was to take photographs as I fancied then write on the train. In practice I've tended to plan in real-time what to write about, take photos accordingly, and write when I didn't feel like sleeping and on the train. Getting a post out was a complex endeavour - downloading, resizing and postprocessing the images was done by hand which takes time - and thus twice (Amsterdam/Hannover posts and Berlin/Prague posts) I've had a first draft written and have gotten all the images and final draftings into place as a batch process. This isn't great, as it's quite the chore, but I'm none too sure how to resolve this besides automating the photo processing as much as possible.

Readers: numbers, people who said they were reading.

Enjoyment: ?

Would do again: did want to write more. relation to travelling alone? exciting possibility of just using my fancy rucksack for shorter trips, especially if travelling with a smaller/cheaper laptop (e.g., USB-C charged 11/13")
