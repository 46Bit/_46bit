The last leg of my trip was an easyJet flight back from Prague to Manchester (within striking distance of Wakefield.) I'm writing from that flight, presumably as it approaches The Netherlands but sadly there's no flight tracker display.

## In the dark

I did something different last night: I did lots of sightseeing by night. On this trip I've mostly used the evening as me-time, simply because I need some time and the night is a little scary and not all that fun when travelling alone. But yesterday I fell asleep for about 4 hours shortly after getting to my hotel, waking kinda hungry and excited at about 9:30pm.

Prague is a fantastic city centre to wander by night. It's easily small enough to cover on foot, has a great deal of interesting architecture, and is still full of sober-enough tourists and open shops at 1am.

I'd ummed and aahed about how to get hold of some CZH - the Czech national currency - and eventually got some from an ATM. The exchange rate from GBP to CZH was approximately 30 at the time, and the resulting novelty of a bill numbered 2000 that was only worth

My sister was rather partial to Prague's Hard Rock Cafe so this was my first stop, for dinner. I know, I know, I ought to be having culturally-authentic food rather than an American chain - but I'm getting to that. Kinda. I had a rather nice cocktail: Malibu in an otherwise ordinary (but gorgeous) smoothie.

On the way out I popped back to the central square, Old Town Square, for photos. The buildings are impressive but didn't suit my night photography, so here's some daytime shots instead.

Next I wanted to wander a bit as I suspected this city/architecture style might work better on cute little streets rather than larger thoroughfares. I think I was right!

Arriving by a nightclub I'd been <s>warned</s> told about, I diverted up towards Charles Bridge. As mentioned it's really quite a small place, on a similar scale to York, and thus this had only taken maybe 15 minutes of strolling.

Charles Bridge is a monumental bridge of black stone with statues of Catholic saints lining the sides. It was a mixed-bag in the dark: spooky and interesting, but mostly just black.

One of my favourite aspects in this bridge was the decoration of the bottom of the tower at the Old Town end. This came out much better at night with the flash than it did in the day.

On the other side of Charles Bridge and up a hill lies Prague Castle. I was tempted to go as far up to it as one can at night and obtain photos out over the city. In practice it became somewhat too eerie and empty for me to want to carry on at 1am, but I got some great shots along the way.

I mentioned getting authentic local food.
