<!--


We fancied a trip to Disney and at Â£42 each it was relatively reasonable.

## Final thoughts

**To be completed.**

<!--
- The walk bit not worth doing, go towards 16th or Sacre-Coeur instead
- Paris eats and drinks late
- Use CityMapper to get around (even more useful than in London, as the transport map is quite complex)
- Paris largely because I'd have company. In practice an extremely enjoyable destination.
- I want to go back having learned more French (Duolingo.) Perhaps to the countryside or a different city, however.
