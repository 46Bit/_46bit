I tried to make some thoughtful points about Brexit on Tuesday night and found it a bit difficult.

71% of my agegroup (18-24) was for Remain. I was very much for Remain. I'm still very much for Remain. What that means is difficult but important to consider. I think the place to start is how I see England. To talk of the UK… that's another level up.

## A view of England from West Yorkshire

On the country level, we're rich and well-developed. 0.8% of humans live here; 3.8% of GDP is here. We're 5% of India's population but 130% of its GDP. We have a great deal of financial industry, some important arms industries, a lot of media, some tourism, …. Manufacturing isn't something all that respected.

The outlook if you're in Leeds, West Yorkshire is very different to if you're in Central London. I got a lot of advantages in life, one being an excellent private education. But even so it was London's prosperity that drove my early career success. By comparison, West Yorkshire feels second-rate - a low-aspirational choice, even. And that attitude is harmful.

* If all the graduates go off to London it props up its housing crisis, but leaves the provinces with less talent.
  * Thus, anyone wanting to hire talented graduates probably would prefer London unless they want to argue the lower-cost-of-living aspect.
* I think a North--South divide is visible in my friends, in terms of aspirations and exposure to opportunity.
* Trains in the North can be dire. Northern Rail runs the most dreadful commuter trains, with the idea of investment or passenger experience a very distant idea. Around here you celebrate if you can take a journey by CrossCountry or Transpennine Express, because they use modern trains rather than a crumbling, dusty shell.
  * Taking one of these each morning really isn't very enchanting. I'm not even critiquing the utility of the local railways here, merely the passenger experience.
* You can see where I'm going here.

## A view of England from York

York is notably more cosmopolitan than most of Yorkshire. We and part of Leeds were the only areas of Yorkshire to go Remain. Our house prices are high for our actual job opportunities, perhaps as a result of being a beautiful and deeply historic countryside city.

## So why does all this matter?

I think there's a few ingredients in the Brexit pot. One is how people like to stick to a simple answer to complex questions, the way a coworker who insists on a particular option but refuses to justify it might be bothersome. Two is how people really should be feeling concerned. Wages have stagnated since
