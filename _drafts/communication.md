About three years ago now I was shown a video of Eulerian Video Magnification, a technique for amplifying ("magnifying") change in videos. From ordinary video you could make heartbeats visible. Cranes a mile away swaying in the wind could rock up and down.

How this worked was entirely outside my understanding. But I was hooked and wanted to learn how.

I learned a bit about Signal Processing for an Embedded Systems project in second year, but I had no conception of how such a thing as this would be done. In any case I was hooked. I spent a lot of time researching this area and playing with Numpy and eventually got something working.
