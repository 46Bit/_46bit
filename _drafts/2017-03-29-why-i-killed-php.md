PHP was my first backend language.
<!--more-->

* At 11.5 I started doing HTML and 'DHTML' on [Freewebs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webs_(web_hosting)).
* By 12.5 I'd got a shared hosting account and was writing PHP.
* By 16, I'd picked up a number of smalltime freelance web development clients.

But then something crucial happened. I don't know where I'd be without it. I started going to open data hackdays. These had experienced developers, very keen on doing things with data or civics and very friendly. They also had us kids, who'd started off going to Young Rewired State events and then went to adult Rewired State events on weekends.

I did some really cool stuff with PHP at these hackdays. But then I 'killed' PHP from my skills. I stopped advertising it, I started declining work in it where possible, and committed to picking up Ruby or Python. To this day my top category [on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/392331/46bit) is PHP and yet my jobs profile there says I don't want to work with it.

## Tools aren't neutral

There's an argument that I've seen: a tool is a tool and the user determines the quality of the work. But in practice? I think poor tools breed poor work. The harder something is to do well the more energy it takes and the less energy you can spend on improvements elsewhere. **Energy required to extract good results gets taken away from everything else.**

In a lot of cases this is true. If you're running a website and not hitting scaling problems you're fine with Ruby, Python, Java, Scala, Go, C# or (in time) Rust. They're all fairly easy to get good results in, they're all fairly productive, and they're serious programming languages.

But PHP as of 2013 was a bad tool. It was the language of boundless SQL Injections and insufficient randomness and an expectation of poor development practice. It seems to have improved since, but I can't say I'd take it seriously as a modern option unless a team was deeply into it.

By many accounts I did some fantastic work with PHP, but I wanted to step up. In practice this took some time - my A Levels studies started, Further Maths proved a fun distraction, and I did a lot less freelance for several years.
