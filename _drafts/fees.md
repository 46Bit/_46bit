## University Fees

I should think I'm one of the very last UK students on £3000 fees. I started my degree five years ago in the final year before higher fees. I lucked out by being born before the Autumn.

As the Tory & Liberal coalition drove towards £9k fees, students came close to rioting outside Parliament. The frustration that they weren't being listened to, that we weren't being listened to, was intense. It didn't seem a necessary change and there were intense fears what this meant for the future of our education system. [FullFact](https://fullfact.org/education/have-governments-tuition-fee-reforms-worked/) analysis paints a mixed picture

I've had a lot of exposure to U.S. universities - Stanford, Princeton, MIT, SIT, …. The fees they pay are intense, the college you pick seems keenly related to what your parents can afford, and the nasty debt repayments are specifically preserved during bankruptcy.

I wondered whether I'd have gone to University at all given the insane new headline figures - more than £40k of debt for a 4-year degree?
