		<h1><a href="/2013/three-birthday-problem">How probable are 3 consecutive birthdays?</a></h1>
		<span class="date">April  1, 2013</span>
	</header>
	<div class="extended"><p>Have you ever wondered what the likelihood is of having three consecutive birthdays in a row? It’s a fun excursion from the classical statisical brain teaser on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">birthday problem</a>. <!--more--></p>
<p>To begin with we’ll <strong>consider the probability of a given three people - let’s call them Alex, Brian and Catherine - having consecutive birthdays.</strong> For those familiar with sets, we’ll represent them with the set <span class="math">\(P = \{ Alex, Brian, Catherine \}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="making-assumptions">Making assumptions</h2>
<p>To keep the Math reasonably simple, we’ll make a few assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Births <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~dgleich/notebook/2009/04/birthday_distribution.html">aren’t evenly distributed</a> throughout the year, but we’ll assume they are.</li>
<li>We’ll ignore leapyears and take a year as 365 days.</li>
<li>We’ll assume these three people are picked at random.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applying-combinatorics">Applying Combinatorics</h2>
<p>Recall that we defined the set of the 3 people as <span class="math">\(P = \{ Alex, Brian, Catherine \}\)</span>.</p>
<p>P can be <em>permuted</em> (ordered) in several different ways, for instance <span class="math">\(( Brian, Alex, Catherine )\)</span> or <span class="math">\(( Catherine, Alex, Brian )\)</span>. How many different permutations are there? Time for a little Combinatorics.</p>
<p>If you’ve done this thing before, recall there are <span class="math">\(m!\)</span> ways to rearrange <span class="math">\(m\)</span> elements. If you’ve no idea what I just said, take a look at <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/108812/how-many-ways-can-we-order-a-set-of-n-elements">this explanation</a>. There are <span class="math">\(|\mathrm{P}| = 3\)</span> birthdays, so there are <span class="math">\(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = \mathbf{6}\)</span> permutations.</p>
<h2 id="applying-probability">Applying Probability</h2>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/independent-dependent-probability/addition_rule_probability/v/addition-rule-for-probability">addition rule</a> we just need to find the probability of a single permutation. We’ll consider <span class="math">\(( Alex, Brian, Catherine )\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex’s birthday can happen on <em>any day of the year</em>, with probability <span class="math">\(\frac{365}{365} = 1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Brian’s birthday must happen on <em>the day after that of Alex</em>, with probability <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{365}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Catherine’s must happen on <em>the day after that of Brian</em>, again with probability <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{365}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These events are all independent, so we can just use the <a href="http://stattrek.com/probability/probability-rules.aspx">multiplication rule</a> to find the chance of them all occurring:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(\frac{365}{365} \times \frac{1}{365} \times \frac{1}{365} = \frac{1}{365^2} = 0.000007506\ldots\)</span></p>
<p>That’s roughly a <span class="math">\(0.00075\%\)</span> chance. Now let’s account for the 6 permutations:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(6 \times \frac{1}{365^2} = \frac{6}{365^2} = 0.00004503\ldots\)</span></p>
<p><b>So the probability of three people having consecutive birthdays is roughly <span class="math">\(0.0045\%\)</span>.</b></p>
<h2 id="applying-this-result-to-groups-of-people">Applying this result to groups of people</h2>
<p>The original Birthday problem ultimately concerns <em>how many people you need in a group for two or more of them to share birthdays</em>.</p>
<p>To do this for our similar problem the key is to use how many different groups of 3 people can arise from a group of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> people. Where <span class="math">\(^{n}C_{k}\)</span> represents these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinations#Number_of_k-combinations">k-combinations</a>, plot the function:</p>
<p><span class="math">\(x \in \mathbb{Z}, x \ge 3,\ y =\ ^{x}C_{3} \times \frac{6}{365^2}\)</span></p>
<p>Then find the first value of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> where <span class="math">\(y &gt; 0.5\)</span>, and you’ve got the smallest number of people where it is probable for there to be three consecutive birthdays.</p>
<p>I’ll leave this final step as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h2 id="footnote">Footnote</h2>
<p>You might get confused if trying to derive this. There are 4 different ways to make 3 days of birthdays as <span class="math">\(( Alex, Brian, Catherine )\)</span>, depending on whether the second two birthdays are the day before or after. However since these 4 different ways are each only of <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> probability it all cancels out.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the wonderful people that reviewed drafts of this post: the statistical <a href="https://www.toastwaffle.com">Samuel Littley</a>, the inventive <a href="http://toys.dreamforge.me/users/nemild">Nemil Dalal</a>, the organised <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyBursh">Andy Bursh</a>, the clarifying <a href="http://issyl0.co.uk">Isabell Long</a> &amp; the syntactical <a href="http://dpk.io">David Kendal</a>.</p>
<p>Any statistical shortcomings are the fault of <a href="https://46b.it/about/">the author</a>, Michael Mokrysz.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong>: I noticed I’d missed out the 4 different ways the birthdays can arise, so corrected for that.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: <a href="https://www.toastwaffle.com">Samuel Littley</a> pointed out that whilst there are indeed 4 ways to make each triple, the probability of any specific one happening means that we divide by 4 again. Post updated with this reasoning.</p></div>
