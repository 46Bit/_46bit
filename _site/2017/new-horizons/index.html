    <p>I handed in my dissertation two weeks ago. There’s a few things to finish up but the major things I’ve wanted to deliver this year - a cryptanalysis report, an evolutionary computing experiment, my video processing dissertation - are all done. So from my perspective I’m pretty much done and awaiting Graduation come July!</p>

<p>The Masters year was exhausting and I’m a little burned out, so I’m hoping not to rush into anything. I’ve wanted to go travelling in Europe for a few years now but kept finding interesting internships instead. Now between University and what-comes-after I have a natural gap.

<p>Friends, culture and history put Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Greece on the list. I’d like to follow Archaeological data I worked with into the Troodos Mountains in Cyprus, but that would be a trip in itself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And the danger is that in this move toward new horizons and far directions, that I may lose what I have now, and not find anything except loneliness.”</p>

  <p>—Sylvia Plath, The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That quote above is one a friend sent me. They’re moving back to east Asia, away from the friends they’ve made here in York and back to a different culture. I sympathise in my own way: I grew up in an isolated village and adopted York as my hometown.</p>

<p>Over these six years London, Hamburg, the San Francisco Bay Area, Cambridge, MA and a few other cities in the U.S. have gained wonderful memories as well. This shows I don’t have to worry, and yet the Plath quote remains.</p>

<p>I’ve chatted with a lot of people about what to do next. It needs to be a step up, and yet it’s hard to know what a step up from effective-CTO of a technically hard startup would be. Delivering in a larger organisation? “Cross-functional agile teams?” Engineering technically-harder things? Making better startup decisions the second time around?</p>

<p>I’m gonna find out.</p>

End of the day, it just has to be rewarding and worthwhile while either paying the bills or working around them.

The UK has taken a disturbing turn in the last year, and I don't quite know what it means for my or our future.

head back into startups I have a choice of doing my own - Dreamforge taught me a lot about the early-stage - or finding a team and direction I like.

I've chatted with a lot of people about what to do next. Deciding on a career direction is tricky.
