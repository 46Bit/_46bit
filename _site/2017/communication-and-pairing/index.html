    <p>GDS is the first time I’ve done a lot of pair programming. It’s been a big learning curve. Getting work done wasn’t too difficult, but making it feel natural and finding defences against it being draining has taken a long time.</p>

<p>I believe that pairing has a lot of positive effects, from better output to more of a shared sense of ownership. Particularly in the platform operations and development work my team does, it’s almost a necessity if we’re to think about all the moving parts. But those positive effects <em>can</em> be at the cost of stress and reduced enjoyment if you find it hard to navigate the social situation.</p>

<h2 id="about-working-in-large-cross-functional-teams">About working in large, cross-functional teams</h2>

<p>I’ve worked in at least 8 different teams over the years, but generally my team <em>was</em> the organisation. Whether there were 5 of us or there might be 15 of us, that was the organisation. Teams were relatively informal. With that background, our cross-functional teams have felt both familiar and frighteningly unfamiliar. They’re familiar in that we have a diversity of talents: I’ve never particularly liked working on a tech team, because it bottlenecked the things I could pay attention to. Cross-functionality lets me see lots about what goes on, and develop lots of different skills, even in a large organisation.</p>

<p>It’s also very unfamiliar. There are a lot of us–the GOV.UK PaaS team is now at least 20 people. (That includes people working with us part time, but they’re just as much a part of the team as anyone else and could be very valuable given they see how other teams work.) 20 people means I have 19 different connections within the team, which is a lot. It’s more than one can readily pay attention to, and that means it takes a long time to get to know people and identify their communication styles. So, there tends to be more awkwardness than in my past work where you’d very quickly get to know the new people.</p>

<h2 id="pairs-are-tiny-ephemeral-teams-with-their-own-culture">Pairs are tiny, ephemeral teams with their own culture</h2>

<p>I’m very sensitive to interpersonal dynamics. I have some issues with gender as a concept, but it definitely correlates with people’s communication styles. I’ve worked on a team of this size before, but it was a mostly female team. (Given how unrepresentative the tech industry is, that seems unfortunately rare.) I tend to find female-led or gender-balanced teams much more natural and friendly to work in. While some have been fantastic, I’ve seen male-dominated teams feel very gruff, unkind and hostile. This might be down to emotional labour being devalued except as a feminine trait–but while that’s inherent to my experiences, I don’t want to get into it right now. The point is, pairing creates temporary teams of a pair of people. Each of those tiny teams has its own culture, but unless you already now how to interact with each other it doesn’t exist for long enough to reach a natural equilibrium. That can mean they’re very stressful for me, as I’m working to navigate the new social situation at the same time as trying to communicate at the same time as doing our work and maybe deciding what to have for lunch.</p>

<p>Pea Tyczynska, a developer at GDS, has helped me a lot with pairing. There’s so much to consider: how to get used to it, the different ways one can apply it, the sorts of ways it can (and does) go wrong, and the sorts of techniques you can use to mitigate or improve the way the pair is working. Her experiences and expertise have been invaluable.</p>

<h2 id="things-still-dont-always-go-brilliantly-and-thats-okay">Things still don’t always go brilliantly (and that’s okay)</h2>

<p>Part of social interactions is that they don’t always go perfectly. And like that, pairing can still not go great. I’ve had to get used to that, trusting that I’ll continually improve at it and that I’ll get better at better at it. The key thing I’m doing, if it feels like you’re talking past each other or not interacting in ways that you can both work with, is to make sure to follow healthy practices. Taking regular breaks, regularly rotating roles, and maybe dividing the work to act independently can all be much more important if it feels unpleasant. But, again, a lot of this is what Pea and a few people like Dan Carley and Lee Porte on my team have taught me. I’m just narrating what it means for me.</p>

<p>I wrote this because I’ve had a few days, pairing on something that did present its share of problems, that were intensely enjoyable and felt quite natural. It isn’t the first time, not by far, but I’m doing a lot more now in my life and in other interests at work so it felt like quite the achievement!</p>

<p style="display: none;">unsure how to express: preserving relationships also seems to be considered a feminine trait<br />
in male teams, I see it as anxiousness and nervousness are being pushed past with agitation rather than skillfully-deployed social niceties
