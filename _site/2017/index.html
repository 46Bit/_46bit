  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/brexit/">Brexit.</a></h2>
  <p>On Tuesday night I tried to tweet some thoughts about Brexit:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I tried to write something about Brexit here and now I&#39;ve gone to find the gin.</p><p>&mdash; Michael Mokrysz (@46bit) <a href="https://twitter.com/46bit/status/846845924991254528">March 28, 2017</a></p></blockquote>

  <p>This blog experienced a lull from <code class="highlighter-rouge">2014-07-07</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">2017-02-27</code>, some 966 days. A lot happened in that timespan - I went through a long period of therapy, spent awhile reverse-engineering Dig data from dead ESRI databases in an Archaeology department, and got into everything from Swing Dancing to Python.</p>

<p>What didn’t change was that the old design, well, sucked. I don’t mean that it was the worst thing ever, but it was underwhelming as a place to write. So I’m going to talk through the redesign process.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/writing-again/">I&#39;ve been published!</a></h2>
  <p>In the last month I’ve had two articles printed in the student newspaper, Nouse. Over the last year I've been collecting data on student union election candidates, and it was fantastic to pull the findings together.</p> <ul>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.nouse.co.uk/2017/02/18/battle-of-the-colleges-whos-got-the-bnocs/">Battle of the colleges: who’s got the BNOCs</a></strong><br />
    I had about 48 hours to do preliminary analysis with a second year of data. Given those constraints and having not done this before, I'm pretty happy with the printed results.
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.nouse.co.uk/2017/03/07/yusu-elections-put-under-the-microscope-college-chances-campus-stances-and-gender-imbalances/">YUSU elections put under the microscope: college chances, campus stances and gender imbalances</a></strong><br />
    A few weeks later I came back with more thoroughly analysed findings. In summary - our Student Union elections seem biased against underprovisioned Colleges and female candidates are running for much more junior positions.

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/security-risk-assessment/">Security Risk Assessments of Semi-Autonomous Vehicles</a></h2>
  <p>I’m in my 4<sup>th</sup> year at York, the Masters year of my MEng Computer Science degree. This term I’ve taken the Topics in Privacy and Security (PSEC) module, which takes a wide technical swath through privacy and security issues. But the assessment is mostly focused on password cracking and doing a security risk assessment for automated road convoys.</p>

<p>We’re assessing how to bring an EU-funded project, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_Road_Trains_for_the_Environment">SARTRE</a>, to market. The concept, “Safe Road Trains for the Environment,” allows an equipped car to automatically follow ~6m behind a Lead Vehicle. You could sit back and watch a movie—er, do productive work.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/bicycle-skid/">Glad I was wearing a cycle helmet</a></h2>
  <p>One of my favourite things about York is how bicyclable it is. I grew up in the countryside but somewhere decidedly not safe to cycle from, so it’s a very welcome change. Aside from a couple of minor things it’s worked fine for the last 5 years. On Friday (<code class="highlighter-rouge">2017-03-10</code>) I had a bit of an accident.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/evco/">Recursive Enum expression trees in Rust</a></h2>
  <p>I mused about an implementation of expression trees in Rust <a href="https://46b.it/2017/rust-generating-syntax-trees/">two days ago</a>. This is to build a Genetic Programming library in Rust - an biologically-inspired approach to finding robust solutions to difficult problems.</p>

<p>As discussed elsewhere I’ve become a keen fan of Rust. This language’s limited generics pose interesting problems for expressing and generating equations as described above.</p>

<p>There are two common ways to represent a tree datastructure:</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/evolutionary-computing/">Introduction to Evolutionary Computing</a></h2>
  <p>I took an Evolutionary Computation course last semester, <a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/postgraduate/modules/evco.html">EVCO</a>. This is a family of techniques where you simulate evolution to find good solutions to problems. Let’s watch an evolutionary process evolve vehicles that can get through a course:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxourrlPlf8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>I’d like to thank <a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/research/ecology-evolution/daniel-franks/">Dr Daniel Franks</a> for a great course, enthusiastic teaching and many of the examples here.</p>

<p>Let’s say you want to learn an equation that approximates a function. This is a simple example - one of my <code class="highlighter-rouge">evco</code> examples <a href="https://github.com/46bit/evco/blob/v0.2.1/examples/snake.rs">evolves Snake players</a>. We’ll use an evolutionary approach called Genetic Programming, which evolves trees representing expressions.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/coldfusion-insecure-escape-spaces/">Securing legacy ColdFusion or: Why escape spaces against XSS?</a></h2>
  <p>I’m in my Masters year at the moment, which means I have a lot fewer classes but a lot higher expectations in assignments. I’m also undertaking an MEng project (I’ll write about this sometime.) So I have a lot more unreserved time but a bit more work to do. I’ve been filling one day a week doing security and maintainance work on old ColdFusion web applications.</p>

<p>ColdFusion is an old web technology that Macromedia put out. It’s like you implementated of PHP in HTML tags. For I have been working with it - trying to secure a large number of small webapps built with it in years gone by.</p>

<p>There’s a bit of a problem with securing these legacy apps. They’re a mess, and <strong>ColdFusion is insecure by default.</strong> Let’s take some typical Ruby <code class="highlighter-rouge">erb</code> markup:</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/rust-generating-syntax-trees/">Generating expression trees in Rust</a></h2>
  <p>I’ve been writing a lot of Rust. Since <a href="https://github.com/Taneb">\@Taneb</a> persuaded me to try it the language has grown phenomenally on me. I’ve always shied away from getting too attached to tools and focused more on systems but for the first time since my early Ruby days I’ve become a language fanboy.</p>

<p>While building my <a href="https://github.com/46bit/evco">Genetic Programming</a> library I needed a convenient way to represent and generate syntax trees. More than anything I wanted users to write a minimum of code. I used an <strong>interesting but problematic</strong> Recursive Enum approach that’s worth discussing.</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="n">Equation</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nf">Add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Box</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Equation</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">Box</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Equation</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="c">// l + r</span>
    <span class="nf">Sub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Box</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Equation</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">Box</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Equation</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="c">// l - r</span>
    <span class="nf">Mul</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Box</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Equation</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">Box</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Equation</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="c">// l × r</span>
    <span class="nf">Div</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">Box</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Equation</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">Box</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Equation</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="c">// l ÷ r</span>
    <span class="nf">Float</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">f64</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="c">// n</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very neat representation of a syntax tree for basic mathematics. One can express math quite simply:</p>

  <h2 class="post-title"><a href="/2017/engineering-discipline-and-craft/">Engineering as slowly as possible</a></h2>
  <p>I’ve become a fan of developing, “as slowly as possible.” It’s proven hard to crystallise what feelings this sums up, but I relate it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems">slow, logical, conscious System Two</a> thinking.</p>

<p>The way you start a project indicates a lot about how it will progress. Something that gets a testsuite early on will probably keep one going; something that is essentially untested is hard to improve. This hill can be climbed over if one is lazy or very disciplined - but sustained effort to undo unforced mistakes is hard.</p>

<p>So making the right decisions at the right time is important. Ideally we should favour sustained velocity over quickly hacking something together and forgetting about it. We should have good craft <em>in order to</em> still move fast: building things well rather than just building them.</p>
