    <p>I’ve made a decision that this blog will be far from purely technical. If you want my engineering or product opinions then you can hire me; this is my personal writing. This decision is somewhat forced by having such a toxic national debate to discuss.</p>

<p><strong>I tried to make some thoughtful points about Brexit on Tuesday night, but found it a bit difficult.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/06/27/how-britain-voted/">71% of my agegroup was for Remain.</a> I was very much for Remain; I’m <em>still</em> very much for Remain. Yet with Article 50 now triggered it seems fairly sure we’re headed ‘out’ in some form.</p>

<p><strong>In the many years to come I hope that people can draw back together and heal these wounds.</strong> But I doubt I will come to think this was the right path. The outcome of this process may have surprise upsides, but that doesn’t necessarily justify the means.</p>

<p><strong>I don’t expect I’ll ‘get behind Brexit’ for the same reason I’d not pick up a copy of the Daily Mail</strong>: it’s a crafted narrative giving the worst of humanity. I hope that we’ll regret this as a nation. But I’m not sure that’s the way it’ll go.</p>

<p>In York I’ve overheard discussions as to whether people want to fill out 85-page residence forms or go find somewhere more willing to have them - particularly relevant here at the University, when research is often funded and conducted on a continental or worldwide scale.</p>

<h3 id="we-already-had-issues">We already had issues</h3>

<p><strong>The sheer difficulty of the process is widely predicted to stall any other governing for several years.</strong> And there are challenges ahead:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The SNP would like to revote on independence and Northern Ireland’s status is unknowable. I wish the people of Scotland all the best whatever they decide, and hypothetically similar for NI.</li>
  <li>The housing crisis eating working people’s incomes will continue on.</li>
  <li>The slide towards buying later will make saving for retirement or any other purpose ever more distant, making us poorer.</li>
  <li>University fees will start to creep upwards at the ‘higher quality’ Universities, to encourage students to balance debt against opportunity.</li>
  <li>High wages will move to the Continent for access reasons.</li>
  <li>The NHS, its staff and its patient may suffer terribly from a lack of nurses.</li>
  <li>Civil liberties and leglisation to protect the world may or may not go in a worse direction.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If the Brexit ordeal is a snapshot of how our highly-developed country will cope with these stressors, the bitterness might become all-consuming.</strong></p>

<h3 id="there-are-severe-problems-to-come">There are severe problems to come</h3>

<p>We’re also headed for quite a few anthropogenic disasters. None of these should read surprising:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Temperatures will rise.</li>
  <li>All coral reefs on Earth may die; ocean acidification will wreak wider havoc (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/07/coral-reefs-disappear-lifetime">source</a>.)</li>
  <li>Glaciers will melt, leaving rivers emptier in the summer.</li>
  <li>Crop failures will grow.</li>
  <li>Extreme climate events will worsen.</li>
  <li>Methane releases from permafrost may grow.</li>
  <li>Some of the Middle East may experience unlivable heatwaves (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/26/extreme-heatwaves-could-push-gulf-climate-beyond-human-endurance-study-shows">source</a>.)</li>
  <li>Seas will rise in ways outside our experience.</li>
  <li>Europe’s population will dwindle. Africa’s population will boom. Asia’s importance will continue to grow. The USA will have a white minority for the first time.</li>
  <li>People in poorer countries will continue to seek better lives, or any life at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a depressing list - I could list as many <em>good</em>, hopeful things just as easily. The point is that these things matter, a lot, to our future. To these problems, Brexit is at best a distraction.</p>

<p>I’ve started making notes as to where I want more detailed posts to go on this. But a good starting point will be to look at the shape the UK’s people are actually in, and what the future held, and what it might now hold.</p>
