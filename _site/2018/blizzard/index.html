    <p>It‚Äôs been quite the Winter for snow in North London. My first winter here has been just as lucky as
was my first in York.</p>

<!--more-->

<!-- FIXME: Picture of snowman in York -->

<p>I live in a city, I don‚Äôt drive and I rely on my feet, bicycles and public transport to get around.
Unless I need to cycle somewhere, I‚Äôm in the perfect position to enjoy and get excited by snow. And
I have!</p>

<!-- FIXME: Picture of Stroud Green in the snow -->

<p>I thought I‚Äôd gotten lucky with a few days of snow in early December. I threw some snowballs,
admired dozens of snowpeople in Finsbury Park (no time to build one, sadly) and got to feel festive.
Getting another week of snow wasn‚Äôt something I hoped for.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs been a blizzard on my hill at times, watching snowflakes zoom down or snow from the ground
whipped up into the air. That‚Äôs been kind of cool, but also a little scary sometimes. Living in a
conservation zone is really nice in some ways, but old-fashioned sash windows really aren‚Äôt airtight
and I‚Äôve had to improvise to seal up some holes.</p>

<p>I have a habit of visiting New England in December, a time of year when it gets awfully cold
weather and blizzards. Last December the wind chill one daygot down to about -22¬∞C. Another day
I walked about six miles through half of a foot of snow, from Cambridge, MA to Downtown Boston.
We haven‚Äôt quite had that here yet but 4 days of snowing and a week of cold weather make me feel
like I‚Äôm there. It feels great.</p>

<!-- FIXME: Picture of the horde of snowpeople -->

<p>But that‚Äôs not the whole story. The cold giving us snow should be growing sea ice in the Arctic. We
might be having fun (unless you‚Äôre trapped on a train overnight!) but Polar Bears in the Arctic will
have less hunting territory. I don‚Äôt know how to change the vast problem that is reducing CO‚ÇÇ
emissions. We‚Äôre not willing to have lower living standards for it, especially when they‚Äôre already
eroding, even if there was a way to negotiate that.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a tragedy and, whatever happens to human civilization, much of what made this world so amazing
will be changed.</p>
