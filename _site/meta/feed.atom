    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m in my Masters year at the moment, which means I have a lot fewer classes but a lot higher expectations in assignments. I’m also undertaking an MEng project (I’ll write about this sometime.) So I have a lot more unreserved time but a bit more work to do. I’ve been filling one day a week doing security and maintainance work on old ColdFusion web applications.</p>
<p>ColdFusion is an old web technology that Macromedia put out. It’s like you implementated of PHP in HTML tags. For I have been working with it - trying to secure a large number of small webapps built with it in years gone by.</p>
<p>There’s a bit of a problem with securing these legacy apps. They’re a mess, and <strong>ColdFusion is insecure by default.</strong> Let’s take some typical Ruby <code>erb</code> markup: <!--more--></p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode ruby"><code class="sourceCode ruby">&lt;input name=<span class="st">&quot;forename&quot;</span> value=<span class="st">&quot;&lt;%= forename %&gt;&quot;</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>&lt;%= … %&gt;</code> tags automatically escape what’s being printed against XSS. The default case is the safe one. Outputting without escaping has to be explictly specified with the <code>raw</code> function. Sadly, ColdFusion only autoescapes in special cases - and I’ve been warned that even then it isn’t bulletproof.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode coldfusion"><code class="sourceCode coldfusion">&lt;cfinput name=&quot;forename&quot; value=&quot;#form.forename#&quot;&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>People running ColdFusion are generally moving to the open source <a href="@TODO">Railo</a> and <a href="@TODO">Lucee</a> servers. These applied a sanity pass to what they should support.</p>
<p>A decision I support is expecting the webapps to work and be secure on both old and new servers. This rules out using anything that was insecure in ColdFusion. It also rules out anything that was new in Railo/Lucee.</p>
<p><img src="/img/coldfusion-insecure-intersection.png" alt="Pictorial depiction of which solutions can be used." width="100%" style="border: 1px solid #ccc;"></p>
<p>The intersection of secure and available in both is to import the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Enterprise_Security_API">OSASP ESAPI API</a> from Java.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode coldfusion"><code class="sourceCode coldfusion">&lt;cfoutput&gt;
    &lt;input name=&quot;forename&quot; value=&quot;#request.esapi.encodeForHTMLAttribute(form.forename)#&quot;&gt;
&lt;/cfoutput&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>Yuck, huh? You might notice we’re using <code>cfoutput</code> and <code>input</code> tags now. As I’ll explain, this works around double-escaping issues.</p>
<h2 id="why-escape-spaces-against-xss">Why Escape Spaces against XSS?</h2>
<p>In one of these application I was escaping a <code>cfinput value</code> with ESAPI:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode coldfusion"><code class="sourceCode coldfusion">&lt;cfinput name=&quot;forename&quot; value=&quot;#request.esapi.encodeForHTMLAttribute(form.forename)#&quot;&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>But on Lucee <code>cfinput</code> is running <code>encodeForHTMLAttribute</code> itself and so we’re double-escaping <code>form.forename</code>. So some characters got double escaped: <code>` (space) &amp;rarr;</code> <code>&amp;rarr;</code>&amp;#32;`.</p>
<p>Instead of <code>Stranger Things</code> your prefilled form field now says <code>Stranger&amp;#32;Things</code>.</p>
<p>You wanted this: <input value="Stranger&#32;Things"><br> You get this: <input value="Stranger&amp;#32;Things"></p>
<p>This could have the approach of escaping almost any character outside <code>/a-z0-9/i</code> but I was genuinely surprised that spaces are escaped. I found myself wondering why. Turns out there is a very good reason. Let’s go back to <code>erb</code>, which escapes by default.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html"><span class="kw">&lt;input</span><span class="ot"> name=</span><span class="st">&quot;forename&quot;</span><span class="ot"> value=</span><span class="er">&lt;</span><span class="st">%=</span><span class="ot"> forename</span> <span class="er">%</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>&gt;</code></pre></div>
<p>See how there’s no quotation marks for the <code>value</code> attribute? HTML is happy without them. So a library that doesn’t escape spaces would leave you vulnerable.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode html"><code class="sourceCode html">forename = &#39;Stranger<span class="dv">&amp;amp;</span>Things onload=alert(&quot;XSS&quot;)&#39;

<span class="kw">&lt;input</span><span class="ot"> value=</span><span class="st">Stranger</span><span class="dv">&amp;amp;</span><span class="st">Things</span><span class="ot"> onload=</span><span class="st">alert(</span><span class="er">&#39;XSS&#39;)</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I think this fits into Defence In Depth. Attribute tags <em>should</em> have the quotation marks, but mistakes happen and nobody is looking for that particular mistake. You have a problem when it only takes one missing quotation mark to open up your website to XSS. Escaping spaces is therefore quite important.</p>
<h2 id="salvaging-legacy-applications">Salvaging legacy applications</h2>
<p>I’ve found this a frustrating but enjoyable bit of work. Legacy is always a bit fascinating - at Archaeology Data Service I was reverse-engineering some ‘interesting’ ESRI XML formats.</p>
<p>I don’t know how completely one can secure applications by hand when they’re messy, insecure by default, and number in the dozens. I’m doing my very best and making heavy use to regexes to check every last <code>#…#</code> and use of <code>cf</code> tags. But this is only a very small slice of ColdFusion’s weirdness: by default it acts like <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/PHP_Programming/Configuration:_Register_Globals">PHP with <code>register_globals</code> turned on</a>.</p>
<p>Well-built software has lingering undiscovered security problems; with sufficient mess one is guaranteed to miss some. But my regexes and discipline does allow eliminating some error classes in near-entirety.</p>
<p>I think my next step should be to fuzz these applications. That’s how they’ll be attacked, so I think it’s absolutely necessary to do it ourselves. I should also take a look into the <code>X-XSS-Protection</code> header, but I’m guessing it isn’t something to rely upon.</p>

    <title>Generating syntax trees in Rust</title>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been writing a lot of Rust. Since <a href="https://github.com/Taneb">@Taneb</a> persuaded me to try it the language has grown phenomenally on me. I’ve always shied away from getting too attached to tools and focused more on systems but for the first time since my early Ruby days I’ve become a language fanboy.</p>
<p>While building my <a href="https://github.com/46bit/evco">Genetic Programming</a> library I needed a convenient way to represent and generate syntax trees. More than anything I wanted users to write a minimum of code. I used an <strong>interesting but problematic</strong> Recursive Enum approach that’s worth discussing.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span class="kw">enum</span> Equation <span class="op">{</span>
    Add(<span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;, <span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;), <span class="co">// l + r</span>
    Sub(<span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;, <span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;), <span class="co">// l - r</span>
    Mul(<span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;, <span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;), <span class="co">// l × r</span>
    Div(<span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;, <span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;), <span class="co">// l ÷ r</span>
    Float(<span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// n</span>
<span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is a very neat representation of a syntax tree for basic mathematics. One can express math quite simply: <!--more--></p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span class="kw">use</span> Equation::*;

<span class="co">// (17.2 × 50.0) ÷ (9.0 - 1.5)</span>
<span class="kw">let</span> eq =
  Div(
    <span class="kw">box</span> Mul(
      <span class="kw">box</span> Float(<span class="dv">17.2</span>),
      <span class="kw">box</span> Float(<span class="dv">50.0</span>)
    ),
    Sub(
      <span class="kw">box</span> Float(<span class="dv">9.0</span>),
      <span class="kw">box</span> Float(<span class="dv">1.5</span>)
    )
  );</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we want to evaluate a tree into an output <code>f64</code>. Here’s a simple recursion:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span class="kw">impl</span> Equation <span class="op">{</span>
    <span class="kw">fn</span> eval(&amp;<span class="kw">self</span>) -&gt; <span class="dt">f64</span> <span class="op">{</span>
        <span class="kw">match</span> *<span class="kw">self</span> <span class="op">{</span>
            Add(<span class="kw">ref</span> left, <span class="kw">ref</span> right) =&gt; left.eval() + right.eval(),
            Sub(<span class="kw">ref</span> left, <span class="kw">ref</span> right) =&gt; left.eval() - right.eval(),
            Mul(<span class="kw">ref</span> left, <span class="kw">ref</span> right) =&gt; left.eval() * right.eval(),
            <span class="co">// In practice I tend to implement a `protectedDiv` which avoids `NaN`.</span>
            Div(<span class="kw">ref</span> left, <span class="kw">ref</span> right) =&gt; left.eval() / right.eval(),
            Float(n) =&gt; n,
        <span class="op">}</span>
    <span class="op">}</span>
<span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="taking-inputs">Taking inputs</h2>
<p>But the tree has a fixed value! That sucks. Let’s make it a real equation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span class="kw">enum</span> Equation <span class="op">{</span>
    Add(<span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;, <span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;), <span class="co">// l + r</span>
    Sub(<span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;, <span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;), <span class="co">// l - r</span>
    Mul(<span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;, <span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;), <span class="co">// l × r</span>
    Div(<span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;, <span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;), <span class="co">// l ÷ r</span>
    Float(<span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// n</span>
    Input,
<span class="op">}</span>

<span class="kw">impl</span> Equation <span class="op">{</span>
    <span class="co">// Eval now takes an input!</span>
    <span class="kw">fn</span> eval(&amp;<span class="kw">self</span>, input: <span class="dt">f64</span>) -&gt; <span class="dt">f64</span> <span class="op">{</span>
        <span class="kw">match</span> *<span class="kw">self</span> <span class="op">{</span>
            Add(<span class="kw">ref</span> left, <span class="kw">ref</span> right) =&gt; left.eval(input) + right.eval(input),
            Sub(<span class="kw">ref</span> left, <span class="kw">ref</span> right) =&gt; left.eval(input) - right.eval(input),
            Mul(<span class="kw">ref</span> left, <span class="kw">ref</span> right) =&gt; left.eval(input) * right.eval(input),
            <span class="co">// In practice I tend to implement a `protectedDiv` which avoids `NaN`.</span>
            Div(<span class="kw">ref</span> left, <span class="kw">ref</span> right) =&gt; left.eval(input) / right.eval(input),
            Float(n) =&gt; n,
            Input =&gt; input,
        <span class="op">}</span>
    <span class="op">}</span>
<span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="going-generic-with-evaluable">Going generic with <code>Evaluable</code></h2>
<p>We can implement a trait to represent an evaluable type and implement it this way. I’m considering an approach like this to genericise over tree-based genetic agents and other forms.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span class="kw">trait</span> Evaluable <span class="op">{</span>
    <span class="kw">type</span> Input;
    <span class="kw">type</span> Output;

    <span class="kw">fn</span> eval(&amp;<span class="kw">self</span>, input: <span class="dt">f64</span>) -&gt; <span class="dt">f64</span> <span class="op">{</span>

            Add(<span class="kw">ref</span> left, <span class="kw">ref</span> right) =&gt; left.eval(input) + right.eval(input),
            Sub(<span class="kw">ref</span> left, <span class="kw">ref</span> right) =&gt; left.eval(input) - right.eval(input),
            Mul(<span class="kw">ref</span> left, <span class="kw">ref</span> right) =&gt; left.eval(input) * right.eval(input),
            <span class="co">// In practice I tend to implement a `protectedDiv` which avoids `NaN`.</span>
            Div(<span class="kw">ref</span> left, <span class="kw">ref</span> right) =&gt; left.eval(input) / right.eval(input),
            Float(n) =&gt; n,
            Input =&gt; input,
        <span class="op">}</span>
    <span class="op">}</span>
<span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="generation">Generation</h2>
<p>Say we implement a function to generate a random nonterminal and a function to generate a random terminal. A new type that chooses whether to generate a nonterminal or terminal can then control various properties of generated trees. The details are a bit too lengthy to put here but this is something that <a href="https://docs.rs/evco/0.2.1/evco/gp/tree/index.html">evco’s <code>Tree</code> and <code>TreeGen</code></a> quite carefully perform.</p>
<h2 id="practical-implementation">Practical implementation</h2>
<p>I find this approach very pretty but it’s quite unsuitable to expect other people to implement to use a library. It’s <a href="https://github.com/46bit/evco/blob/669dc40d2e4e3681e0f3d0c97c70fb0157784886/examples/symbolic_regression.rs#L27-L100">at least 50 ugly lines of code</a> for users of my library to implement methods to generate the tree.</p>
<p>Having other people implement these methods also removes much hope of keeping things tail-recursive. Recursive datastructures are notorious for operations upon them blowing the stack and crashing the program.</p>
<p>I implemented tail-recursive iteration <a href="https://github.com/46bit/evco/blob/669dc40d2e4e3681e0f3d0c97c70fb0157784886/src/gp/tree/mod.rs#L98-L121">inside the library</a> but it’s too complex for third-parties to replicate without risking bugs.</p>
<h2 id="custom-derive">Custom derive</h2>
<p>One way around this issue of people having to implement tedious methods is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/procedural-macros.html">a custom derivation</a> (<code>proc_macro_derive</code>.) The macro could analyse the types in the tree, identify enum variants as terminal vs nonterminal, and generate the methods accordingly.</p>
<p>This has implementation questions. A typical program doesn’t want to be provided with a random <code>f64</code> - it wants one in a particular range. So we could require users to implement new types to wrap that, or allow attributes to mark the range to use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span class="at">#[</span>derive<span class="at">(</span>GeneratableTree<span class="at">)]</span>
<span class="kw">enum</span> Equation <span class="op">{</span>
    Add(<span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;, <span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;), <span class="co">// l + r</span>
    Sub(<span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;, <span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;), <span class="co">// l - r</span>
    Mul(<span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;, <span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;), <span class="co">// l × r</span>
    Div(<span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;, <span class="dt">Box</span>&lt;Equation&gt;), <span class="co">// l ÷ r</span>
    <span class="at">#[</span>evco<span class="at">(</span>range <span class="at">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;-10..10&quot;</span><span class="at">)]</span>
    Float(<span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// n</span>
<span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="alternative-better-implementations">Alternative, better implementations</h2>
<p>The biggest irritation with the datastructure is that accessing a particular node takes <code>O(n)</code> operations because you have to traverse the entire tree to find it.</p>
<p>One can take an approach like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree">B-tree</a> to optimise searching for elements. Sadly this doesn’t suit evolutionary computation very much: mutation is about as common as accessing and trees cannot be rebalanced.</p>
<p>So it would be better to store trees as something other than a recursive datastructure where each node is in its own allocated memory.</p>
<h2 id="heap">Heap</h2>
<p>A common means of representing trees on a computer is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)">Heap datastructure</a>. This structures nodes into an array thus getting better cache locality, quicker access times, etc. The problem is that the enum we have is inherently a recursive structure.</p>
<p>Let’s try this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span class="kw">enum</span> Equation <span class="op">{</span>
    Add(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// l + r</span>
    Sub(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// l - r</span>
    Mul(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// l × r</span>
    Div(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// l ÷ r</span>
    Float(<span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// n</span>
<span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We could build and evaluate variants as we go, using this and the heap. But how do we indicate stored data versus arguments? We could supply stored data as a reference maybe?</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span class="kw">enum</span> Equation <span class="op">{</span>
    Add(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// l + r</span>
    Sub(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// l - r</span>
    Mul(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// l × r</span>
    Div(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// l ÷ r</span>
    Float(&amp;<span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// n</span>
<span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This isn’t very pretty. One option would be that <code>f64</code> inherently is generated and <code>Float</code> becomes unnecessary.</p>
<h2 id="types">Types</h2>
<p>A further issue to consider: none of this uses generic types. All this only passes around <code>f64</code> and nothing else. I guess we could indicate return types by requiring mutable pointers? The code to make this work might be ugly but it’ll be custom derived after all.</p>
<p>This allows specifying return type of each node, but generation logic would have to specify the tree’s root node to get a consistent type out the top of the trees:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode rust"><code class="sourceCode rust"><span class="kw">enum</span> Equation <span class="op">{</span>
    Add(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>, &amp;<span class="kw">mut</span> <span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// l + r</span>
    Sub(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>, &amp;<span class="kw">mut</span> <span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// l - r</span>
    Mul(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>, &amp;<span class="kw">mut</span> <span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// l × r</span>
    Div(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>, &amp;<span class="kw">mut</span> <span class="dt">f64</span>), <span class="co">// l ÷ r</span>
    IfEq(<span class="dt">f64</span>, <span class="dt">f64</span>, &amp;<span class="kw">mut</span> <span class="dt">bool</span>),
<span class="op">}</span></code></pre></div>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve become a fan of developing, “as slowly as possible.” It’s proven hard to crystallise what feelings this sums up, but I relate it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems">slow, logical, conscious System Two</a> thinking.</p>
<p>The way you start a project indicates a lot about how it will progress. Something that gets a testsuite early on will probably keep one going; something that is essentially untested is hard to improve. This hill can be climbed over if one is lazy or very disciplined - but sustained effort to undo unforced mistakes is hard.</p>
<p>So making the right decisions at the right time is important. Ideally we should favour sustained velocity over quickly hacking something together and forgetting about it. We should have good craft <em>in order to</em> still move fast: building things well rather than just building them. <!--more--></p>
<p>There’s a balance between productivity (immediate gratification) and quality of craft. Small hacks and hobby projects which might be thrown away should favor early productivity. Larger projects, ones worked on infrequently, or ones shared with others should favor craft. One needs to pick correctly.</p>
<p>The natural question is where do you place projects with potential? If a prototype can lead to bigger things but also be in the bin inside a week?</p>
<ul>
<li>Throwaway projects can have a long lifetime. I hacked together some scraping and cleanup tools for University of York Student Union candidates last year, but at least twenty people I had to email for their information. This year I <a href="http://www.nouse.co.uk/2017/02/18/battle-of-the-colleges-whos-got-the-bnocs/">published an analysis piece in Nouse student newspaper</a> on a 36-hour turnaround. My quick hack now had to automate the entire process because of time constraints.<br><br></li>
<li>Involved projects can have a surprisingly short lifetime. The high-quality cybersecurity practicals I worked on all last summer have yet to see the light of day. The ambitious systems I built at Dreamforge in 2012-13 have mostly been offline for two years now - our proof-of-concept <a href="http://cookiecaster.com">Cookie Caster</a> is the sole brilliant survivor.<br><br></li>
<li>Poor craft tends to bite you in the butt when you can least afford it. Our software at Dreamforge worked quite well for Cookie Caster and for much of the Fraemes project.

    <title>UoYBus: bus times for the University of York</title>
    <link href="https://46b.it/2014/uoybus/index.html" />
    <id>https://46b.it/2014/uoybus/index.html</id>

    <updated>2014-07-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since November I’ve been quietly running <a href="http://uoyb.us">UoYBus</a>, a live bus times webapp focused on the particular whims of the #4 and #44 bus routes serving <a href="http://york.ac.uk">University of York</a>. Today I released a big improvement. <!--more--></p>
<p>Both bus routes go to the Railway Station and the far end of Campus, but in both the City Centre and on Campus they take quite different routes. Thus it’s quite handy to be able to get times for both sets of stops quickly.</p>
<p>In January we put a jQuery UI-based frontend on it, but this bolt-on interface left much to be resolved in user experience. Since it’s holidays and I’ve had to take a month off, I decided to sketch up an improved design.</p>
<h2 id="difficulties-in-design">Difficulties in design</h2>
<p>The key thing about UoYBus is that it isn’t a generalised bus app, of which dozens exist already. Thus it needs a dead simple interface of (a) where in York are you and (b) where are you going?</p>
<p>I’m not a huge fan of geolocation, so for now I’ve stuck to a traditional web interface. I assume most app users are going to be experienced Yorkers, thus the issue is more deciding which stop to go to than how to get there. This is going to change when I add on a full journey planner, hopefully in time for September’s new students.</p>
<p>To begin with the redesign I took inspiration from the 1D user interface of Yo - a list of big, bright rectangle buttons. This proved reasonably effective but the user feedback wasn’t so good. It also doesn’t allow much room for expansion, as anything but big buttons look out of place.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/uoybus-yo.png" />

</div>
<p>That’s too bold a design, and picking so many colours proved tricky.</p>
<h2 id="route-based-design">Route-based design</h2>
<p>Following this I decided to pick up the route concept from National Rail Enquiries and CityMapper, considering the line of stops buses make rather than a dislocated series of stops. This led me to the final design concept.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/uoybus-home.png" />

</div>
<p>This is remarkably flexible but also familiar to users of other travel apps. Since the first and last stop areas have implicit directions, there’s no need for the extra direction option present in the jQuery UI design. A similar screen suffices for choosing which way you’re going.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/uoybus-result.png" />

</div>
<p>The final results page includes two minor nice features. The stop list is abbreviated to give the final stop only, with a wider dotted line to indicate skipped stops. Whilst not live yet I can use the final stop to give more information like walking directions and the current weather - a lot of bus journeys aren’t worth the cost when you have to wait.</p>
<h2 id="open-development">Open development</h2>
<p>The code behind UOYBus needs a lot of work, but is MIT-licensed on <a href="https://github.com/46bit/uoybus">Github</a>. Beyond adding a lot of useful information to UoYBus itself, I’d like to make the app easier to repurpose.</p>
<p>I want to factor out the York-specific data and enable anyone to run this for their local busroute within minutes. I’ve some ideas about doing this, but it’s tricky to do.</p>
<h2 id="commercial-viability">Commercial viability</h2>
<p>The difficulty running this sort of live bus app is paying for the <a href="http://transportapi.com">API calls</a> when effectively nonprofit. I’m going to try ads whilst promoting UoYBus, given a lot of companies in York want to promote things to students.</p>
<p>My big hope for this long-term is to build a Yorkshire guide integrating attractions, events, transport. Something of a travel guide for locals and non-locals alike. York is the perfect place to pilot something like this.</p>
<p>For now, give <a href="http://uoyb.us">UoYBus</a> a try!</p>]]></summary>

    <title>You can't unsell Hospital Records</title>

    <updated>2014-02-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Telegraph reported today that hospital records from 1997-2010 have been <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10656893/Hospital-records-of-all-NHS-patients-sold-to-insurers.html">sold to insurance companies</a>. They appear to be referring to HSCIC’s <a href="http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hes">Hospital Episode Statistics</a>, a database of NHS hospital records. <!--more--></p>
<blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;] a report by a major UK insurance society discloses that it was able to obtain 13 years of hospital data – covering 47 million patients – in order to help companies “refine” their premiums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report by the Staple Inn Actuarial Society – a major organisation for UK insurers – details how it was able to use NHS data covering all hospital in-patient stays between 1997 and 2010 to track the medical histories of patients, identified by date of birth and postcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;− [Hospital records of all NHS patients sold to insurers](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/10656893/Hospital-records-of-all-NHS-patients-sold-to-insurers.html), The Telegraph, February 23rd 2014&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The Telegraph haven’t published the report being discussed which makes the details very hard to determine, although HSCIC offer a custom data extraction service that might be able to provide details beyond summary statistics.</p>
<p>The combination of postcode and date of birth is absolutely not anonymised data, and so should be subject to the Data Protection Act. That Staple Inn were able to unmask it is further proof in this regard.</p>
<p>HSCIC have questions to answer, but the naivete the Department of Health showed to The Telegraph is remarkable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Department of Health said: “The rules changed last year so this would no longer be allowed. Information like this can only be accessed now if there is a clear benefit to improving health or health systems.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a huge misunderstanding of the situation. Having sold 13 years of medical records to the private sector, a rule change to prevent further sales is naive at best. The problem is not that the data is for sale, the issue is it was ever sold. In 5 years, in 10 years, the DOH can just sell the new data.</p>
<p>In future, giving patients notional ownership of their records seems a good idea. Any sale should have to be approved by them, and a portion of any upside given to them. <a href="http://dpk.io/medicalrecords">David Kendal</a> has already started to try this approach, offering to sell his medical records to interested researchers.</p>
<p>Certainly a start might be to add a clause to the data contracts stating that any attempt to deanonymise the data breaches contract. The Data Protection Act prevents reversible disclosure, so the loss of value of the data should not be a concern.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a while since my last post. After living in London for a few months and working out of <a href="http://shoreditchworks.com">Shoreditch Works</a>, I chose to head back to <a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk">York</a> with the new academic year - rather a tough choice given my other, international option. <!--more--></p>
<p>It might seem strange to those I met in the last 18 months - UnCollege, friends in the YC and hacker crowds - that I’ve decided to go back to formal education. I deliberately chose to take a leave of absence rather than actually quit in order to make this possible, but I wasn’t convinced I would do it until late September.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of truth in what groups like UnCollege are saying - the teaching you get at College might often be given just as well online. If teaching is the only thing you’ve gone to College for, replacing that could be rather easy. I’ve changed quite a bit, and I am enjoying myself a lot more than in the first year.</p>
<p>I’ve a lot of respect for those who think differently on whether College is for them. It’s not for everyone, and isn’t a perfect <s>galaxy</s> system. Choosing to go into industry or explore things yourself is easily as legitimate as College - just treated differently by snotty culture.</p>
<p>Computer Science lines up fairly well with my interests - it’s a good place to anchor my interests. Between Math, Physics and Electronics societies there’s a plenty of broader things I can learn, although I do wish I could take more elective modules in other departments than York allow.</p>
<p>Years of events and long-distance friendships around the data/government crowd has left me needing time to recharge. I’d like to contribute to mySociety when I get back into this, but at the moment I’m too focused on other things like C and transport timetables.</p>
<!--I've slowly become aware of tragedies littering some areas around hacking and governance. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't unnerving to realise how simple SQL Injections or a scraping bot can make areas of government determined to ruin your life. I'm hoping to chat a lot more about this come December at [30C3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/) in Hamburg - hope to see you there.-->
<p>So that’s an update. It might not be coming through well, but I am fairly happy. Being around people closer to my own age is proving very beneficial, as have courses and societies that are giving me a new viewpoint and encouraging deeper thought.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the heaps of people who’ve given me an interesting 18 months, too many to even try to name.</p>]]></summary>

    <title>How probable are 3 consecutive birthdays?</title>
    <link href="https://46b.it/2013/three-birthday-problem/index.html" />
    <id>https://46b.it/2013/three-birthday-problem/index.html</id>

    <updated>2013-04-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered what the likelihood is of having three consecutive birthdays in a row? It’s a fun excursion from the classical statisical brain teaser on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem">birthday problem</a>. <!--more--></p>
<p>To begin with we’ll <strong>consider the probability of a given three people - let’s call them Alex, Brian and Catherine - having consecutive birthdays.</strong> For those familiar with sets, we’ll represent them with the set <span class="math inline">\(P = \{ Alex, Brian, Catherine \}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="making-assumptions">Making assumptions</h2>
<p>To keep the Math reasonably simple, we’ll make a few assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Births <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~dgleich/notebook/2009/04/birthday_distribution.html">aren’t evenly distributed</a> throughout the year, but we’ll assume they are.</li>
<li>We’ll ignore leapyears and take a year as 365 days.</li>
<li>We’ll assume these three people are picked at random.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="applying-combinatorics">Applying Combinatorics</h2>
<p>Recall that we defined the set of the 3 people as <span class="math inline">\(P = \{ Alex, Brian, Catherine \}\)</span>.</p>
<p>P can be <em>permuted</em> (ordered) in several different ways, for instance <span class="math inline">\(( Brian, Alex, Catherine )\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(( Catherine, Alex, Brian )\)</span>. How many different permutations are there? Time for a little Combinatorics.</p>
<p>If you’ve done this thing before, recall there are <span class="math inline">\(m!\)</span> ways to rearrange <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> elements. If you’ve no idea what I just said, take a look at <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/108812/how-many-ways-can-we-order-a-set-of-n-elements">this explanation</a>. There are <span class="math inline">\(|\mathrm{P}| = 3\)</span> birthdays, so there are <span class="math inline">\(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = \mathbf{6}\)</span> permutations.</p>
<h2 id="applying-probability">Applying Probability</h2>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/independent-dependent-probability/addition_rule_probability/v/addition-rule-for-probability">addition rule</a> we just need to find the probability of a single permutation. We’ll consider <span class="math inline">\(( Alex, Brian, Catherine )\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex’s birthday can happen on <em>any day of the year</em>, with probability <span class="math inline">\(\frac{365}{365} = 1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Brian’s birthday must happen on <em>the day after that of Alex</em>, with probability <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{365}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Catherine’s must happen on <em>the day after that of Brian</em>, again with probability <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{365}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These events are all independent, so we can just use the <a href="http://stattrek.com/probability/probability-rules.aspx">multiplication rule</a> to find the chance of them all occurring:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{365}{365} \times \frac{1}{365} \times \frac{1}{365} = \frac{1}{365^2} = 0.000007506\ldots\)</span></p>
<p>That’s roughly a <span class="math inline">\(0.00075\%\)</span> chance. Now let’s account for the 6 permutations:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(6 \times \frac{1}{365^2} = \frac{6}{365^2} = 0.00004503\ldots\)</span></p>
<p><b>So the probability of three people having consecutive birthdays is roughly <span class="math inline">\(0.0045\%\)</span>.</b></p>
<h2 id="applying-this-result-to-groups-of-people">Applying this result to groups of people</h2>
<p>The original Birthday problem ultimately concerns <em>how many people you need in a group for two or more of them to share birthdays</em>.</p>
<p>To do this for our similar problem the key is to use how many different groups of 3 people can arise from a group of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> people. Where <span class="math inline">\(^{n}C_{k}\)</span> represents these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinations#Number_of_k-combinations">k-combinations</a>, plot the function:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(x \in \mathbb{Z}, x \ge 3,\ y =\ ^{x}C_{3} \times \frac{6}{365^2}\)</span></p>
<p>Then find the first value of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(y &gt; 0.5\)</span>, and you’ve got the smallest number of people where it is probable for there to be three consecutive birthdays.</p>
<p>I’ll leave this final step as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<h2 id="footnote">Footnote</h2>
<p>You might get confused if trying to derive this. There are 4 different ways to make 3 days of birthdays as <span class="math inline">\(( Alex, Brian, Catherine )\)</span>, depending on whether the second two birthdays are the day before or after. However since these 4 different ways are each only of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> probability it all cancels out.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the wonderful people that reviewed drafts of this post: the statistical <a href="https://www.toastwaffle.com">Samuel Littley</a>, the inventive <a href="http://toys.dreamforge.me/users/nemild">Nemil Dalal</a>, the organised <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyBursh">Andy Bursh</a>, the clarifying <a href="http://issyl0.co.uk">Isabell Long</a> &amp; the syntactical <a href="http://dpk.io">David Kendal</a>.</p>
<p>Any statistical shortcomings are the fault of <a href="https://46b.it/about/">the author</a>, Michael Mokrysz.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 1</strong>: I noticed I’d missed out the 4 different ways the birthdays can arise, so corrected for that.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong>: <a href="https://www.toastwaffle.com">Samuel Littley</a> pointed out that whilst there are indeed 4 ways to make each triple, the probability of any specific one happening means that we divide by 4 again. Post updated with this reasoning.</p>]]></summary>

<p>Companies will happily sell for millions and risk the evaporation of their communities, especially if current earnings aren’t that cracking. They also might start to commercialize a community in the way Twitter has, or close down a useful platform because it didn’t make much cash.</p>
<p>Just look at <a href="https://tinkercad.com">TinkerCad</a>, the in-browser CAD environment for creating 3D models. It was a fantastic use of technology and very useful for me from time to time, yet now it is being retired - I suspect because the earnings never matched up to the time, money and effort invested.</p>
<p>Wikipedia’s occasional funding drives are an interesting case. The complaints from people fed up of seeing Jimmy Wales’ face peering at them asking for donations act as pretty great promotion. The oft-repeated alternative is to become advertising-driven for some/all of the site’s income - yet much of the benefit of asking ordinary people to donate is that they feel personally invested in the project.</p>
<p>I’m really just trying to work out where the differences between for- and not-for-profit organisations start, what we can aim for and how people can depend on cloud services that can die out of the blue as compared to desktop software that still works a decade after it’s authors are out of business.</p>
<p>I hesitate to say that all true communities would need to be non-profits, that all platforms are nothing of the sort and so forth - but I do wonder.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The computer in front of you is pretty powerful, but it can’t factor a 600-digit number before Earth gets cooked by the Sun. No supercomputer humanity does or could build could do that either, so it seemed a sure bet to base the security of some encryption schemes on factoring being (exponentially) hard. <!--more--></p>
<p>A quantum computer of sufficient size could do it using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s algorithm</a>. It could also allow you to simulate n-body problems in reasonable (polynomial) time. Thus you could break RSA encryption or simulate the interior of the sun right down to the sub-atomic scale.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever looked at Physics like the two-slit experiment, what follows might seem a little reminiscent. That’s because it is.</p>
<h2 id="a-hardwired-machine">A hardwired machine</h2>
<p>In the early days, computers were often programmed by altering their wiring. Instead of running a program stored on disk, computers like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC">ENIAC</a> had a number of units that were manually patched together every time you wanted to run a different program. You’d wire a floating-point multiplier up to vacuum tubes with it’s input, then wire the output up to the next stage.</p>
<p>The model of quantum computers looks a lot like that. You’re not going to sit in front of a quantum computer and write some C++ to define the program to run: rather you’ll have to wire it up for every different program. It’s not quite as simple as a metal wire either, since you’ve got to be very careful to not destroy the quantum effects you look to exploit.</p>
<p>I think it should be possible for a 2nd or 3rd generation computer to have this wiring quickly done by another computer, such that you could have most of the benefits of stored-programs. I speculate this mode of operation would be similar to programming modern FPGAs using VHDL, but I’ve not looked for research in this area yet.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-flip-is-a-qubit">What the flip is a qubit?</h2>
<p>A lot of people have heard that the quantum computer’s form of a <code>bit</code> is called a <code>qubit</code>. The principle behind them is relatively simple to read about but harder (as with everything in quantum mechanics) to appreciate.</p>
<p>An ordinary <code>bit</code> is either 0 or 1. There’s no middle ground. A <code>qubit</code> on the other hand can be both 0 and 1 right up until the moment you observe it. There’s a probability you’ll observe it as a 0, and another probability you’ll observe a 1. This probability as to which state it’s in is called superposition.</p>
<p>How you’d observe a <code>qubit</code> depends on your implementation of them, but it amounts to when you have an instrument measure their value. This measurement collapses the qubit into a classical state, so if you read the qubit again you’ll read the same value as you did earlier.</p>
<p>Stopping this collapse into classical state from happening to the qubits whilst you’re computing is known as quantum decoherence. It’s one of the greatest problems to building a practical quantum computer.</p>
<p>That’s it for a quick introduction. I’ve had to skip <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">entanglement</a> for now until I’m a bit more comfortable explaining it from the point of view of quantum computation. Possible algorithms, some Math and implementation detail discussion is what I’ll start to discuss next time.</p>]]></summary>

    <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I mentioned Network Rail’s feeds briefly last time but hadn’t yet looked into them much. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/SMLittley/status/295175976818728963">Samuel Littley</a> for letting me know a bit more about them. <a href="https://datafeeds.networkrail.co.uk/ntrod/">Sign up</a> and your access will be activated within an hour or so. Given that mine was granted at 3am GMT I suspect it’s automated. <!--more--></p>
<p>My interest in this data comes down to how much I take trains to London, Manchester and elsewhere. Ever since I <a href="/2011/08/13/yrs2011/">built TrainTrackr</a> in 2011 I’ve wanted to get a better idea of how late trains really are. These open data <s>feeds</s> firehoses offer me that chance.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-data">Using the data</h2>
<p><strong>After getting access I discovered that the entire Data Feeds is almost as close to undocumented as you can get.</strong> Thankfully I’d signed up to a talk at the <a href="http://www.theodi.org">Open Data Institute</a> on this topic, given by <a href="https://twitter.com/madprof">Jonathan Raper</a>.</p>
<p>The honest truth is that it seems to be quite a pain. A few immediate problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Rail may have released access to live train times, but the documentation around it is extremely lacking. This is apparently a result of the convoluted system the railways operate under.</li>
<li><strong>The volume of data during the day is pretty big.</strong> At least 500 messages a second. There’s no reason you can’t deal with that amount of data but the real problem is that <strong>your API connection often drops</strong>, causing you to miss some trains setting off. If you miss trains setting off from their first station, you’ll struggle to work out where it’s going along the entire route.</li>
</ul>
<p>You then face the fact there’s half a dozen different datasets: the train timetable, the live updates, changes to train journeys - and when trains have to divert you can lose track of where it’s going altogether.</p>
<h2 id="learning-more">Learning more</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly the train community got to this before I did, so there’s quite a bit of useful things out there. I’ve not managed to find any overview/introduction that’s up to date, so I might end up writing one next month.</p>
<p>If you want train data in a format where it’s ready to build a Mobile API, try <strong><a href="https://developer.transportapi.com">Placr’s Transport API</a></strong>. Free for &lt;1000 hits a day, paid above that. Placr’s founder gave the ODI talk I mentioned, the slides are <strong><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/123365071/Friday-Lunchtime-Lectures-at-the-ODI-How-can-Open-Data-Revolutionise-your-Rail-Travel">available online</a></strong>.</p>
<p>For an example of what can be done in terms of end-user applications, see <strong><a href="http://www.realtimetrains.co.uk">Real Time Trains</a></strong> by Tom Cairns. There’s also plenty of information <strong><a href="http://thomas-cairns.co.uk">on his blog</a></strong> regarding the different data formats - and better, lots of relevant code <strong><a href="https://github.com/swlines">on Github</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://blog.poggs.com">Peter Hicks</a></strong> also has some <strong><a href="https://github.com/poggs">useful code</a></strong> available, although seemingly focused on timetables rather than the live data. He gave a <strong><a href="http://blog.poggs.com/2012/09/okfestival/">relevant talk</a></strong> last September in Helsinki that dives a bit more into licensing issues and so forth.</p>

<p>I’ve got a much better idea what I’m doing than a couple of weeks ago, so I’m going to go out and start getting the data. Next post on this probably a few weeks away. <strong>Thanks a lot to all mentioned for their help.</strong></p>]]></summary>
