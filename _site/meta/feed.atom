For a few hours I’d considered staying an extra day in Amsterdam, spending most of it sunbathing in Vondelpark, and skipping Hannover. But then the 30°C weather broke and that option became relatively less appealing. Thus today is my last day here, and I wanted to round it out by learning a bit more about Amsterdam itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-palace.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam has a lot of sides to it. You could spend a partyish few days smoking weed, partying, walking through the Red Light District and (presumably not in that district) trying to get laid - but, to be honest, that only sounds fun when bringing friends along. You could spend a painful few days visiting the Anne Frank Museum and the like - but I’m mostly leaving that part of history until Berlin. You could spend a chill few days enjoying the architecture, parks, history, museums - and that’s largely what I’ve done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-selfie.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amsterdam-museum&quot;&gt;Amsterdam Museum&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out by visiting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amsterdammuseum.nl/en&quot;&gt;Amsterdam Museum&lt;/a&gt;, with permanent exhibits on Amsterdam’s history (independence from Spain, the Golden Age, the building of the canal layout, the Nazi Occupation and 60s/70s counterculture) and temporary exhibits on fascinating bits of culture (Puck and Hans fashion designers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d love to go back in time and try wearing the below as school uniform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-museum-puck-hans.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really quite proud of how I’ve dressed so far this trip. I’ve been overweight for a long time, which naturally means a degree of body image problems. But this trip I’ve been wearing short-sleeves and shorts and it’s been great. It is no longer 35°C outside but 24°C is easily sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I followed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/20/chips-are-down-for-belgian-frites-as-eu-acts-on-chemical&quot;&gt;tip from The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; and went to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/MjGKSYg1n5k&quot;&gt;get some frites.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; They were indeed very gorgeous, especially with some sort of mayonaise that I picked at random off a list in Dutch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;canal-tour&quot;&gt;Canal Tour&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve walked a very long way every day of this trip so far. My feet hurt. Thus I needed something to do sitting down. By pure chance, Amsterdam is a city with canals whose view of the city beats that of the streets. So I went on a canal tour, for €11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-canaltour.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ooh, the Tulip Museum I visited &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/amsterdam-tulips-pancakes/&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-tulip-museum-tour.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aah, the Canal-side Rebuild I saw &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/amsterdam-tulips-pancakes/&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-canalside-rebuild-tour.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The building in the distance below is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hetscheepvaartmuseum.nl&quot;&gt;The National Maritime Museum&lt;/a&gt;. I didn’t get a chance to visit but I’m sure it’s amazing given Dutch history and Google reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-maritime-museum.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end we went near a vast area of modern 10-storey buildings. I think the waterfront has been recently redeveloped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-shore-newdevelopments.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I found myself back in Vondelpark and started to write &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/amsterdam-tulips-pancakes/&quot;&gt;yesterday’s post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-ducks-again.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading East towards Berlin and Prague, I think I might read the Diary of Anne Frank. I need a new book to read and while I haven’t managed to visit this trip I certainly would in future - but make sure to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.annefrank.org&quot;&gt;book online&lt;/a&gt; a week or two in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a bonus picture, as I love the height difference of the black house:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam really is full of bicycles. It’s remarkably prevalent and cyclists are remarkably confident in their right-of-way. As a cyclist myself it’s really quite stunning to watch. Sadly only watch: I tripped and grazed my hands exactly where you hold handlebars. The segregated red bicycle lanes are sometimes very clear as a pedestrian - and sometimes not.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-cycle-oops.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to Paris the architecture feels a lot more variable and to me a lot more charming. It’s also a lot harder to photograph: from the street you’re obstructed by the trees, and I’ve noticed that the Amsterdam Museum has a painting which deliberately omits the trees in order to focus upon the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve wanted to visit ever since I saw the movie adaptation of A Fault In Our Stars. While a major tourist destination, it had never been on my radar until I saw how cute and exciting it was. On a related note, I really dislike how in the book they stayed in a cheap hotel sharing rooms but in the movie they had them in a fancy, expensive hotel with individual rooms…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-day-2-canal-1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-day-2-canal-2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tulips-and-pancakes&quot;&gt;Tulips and Pancakes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first stop was a little esoteric: the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amsterdamtulipmuseum.com/en/&quot;&gt;Tulip Museum&lt;/a&gt; in the Jordaan neighbourhood. It discusses the origins of Tulips, their introduction to Tulip Mania and how the Dutch ended up in Tulip Mania: a major price bubble in 1637 where the newly-introduced tulips were being exchanged for apparently extraordinary prices. Sadly I don’t have a great photo for this, but it’s worth a visit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-tulip-museum.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About this time I’d started to feel a little bit lonely. I’m used to enjoying my own company from my teen years, but it always takes some getting used to. My sister headed home from Paris and it’s just me for the rest of the trip (another week to go!) At first I wasn’t sure how best to overcome this, so resolved to keep going about the day I’d started to plan out in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next, I got pancakes! I must say, York’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://doubledutchpancakehouse.com&quot;&gt;Double Dutch Pancake House&lt;/a&gt; really stood its ground against what’s apparently a renowned (if touristy) pancake house. Mine was baked rather than fried, but otherwise was quite comparable. The below was about as much as I could eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-half-pancake.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about this time, the glorious weather thus far with 32+°C days and 20+°C nights broke in spectacular fashion. We got hit by a big rain shower, from which I had to hide a postcard as I had no bag. Then as I was hurrying back towards the central island (Centrum?) when a rather intense thunderstorm hit. As if from nowhere the people on the street changed from t-shirt-and-shorts-clad to long-sleeves-and-jeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-storm.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bodies&quot;&gt;Bodies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d hoped to visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Worlds&quot;&gt;Body Worlds&lt;/a&gt; while in Amsterdam and this proved an excellent place to take shelter. Lightning hit something rather close as I got my ticket, and everything shook. Thankfully the power stayed on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the rain hit I started to feel a lot better. The hardest thing about spending lots of time by yourself (or in charge) is keeping a sense of direction, and having formed one for the rest of the day I just enjoyed the novelty of a rainstorm after so many days of Florida-like weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Body Worlds proved one of the most unique and fascinating exhibitions I’ve visited. It’s actually a partnership between Body Worlds and The Happiness Project, and the mix of the two works surprisingly well. Each floor is a mix of the human body (e.g., the nervous system) and the human condition (e.g., positive mindsets.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-bodyworlds-arteries.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-bodyworlds-saxophone.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The top floor has the nervous system from real human bodies. Both individual ‘pieces’ and the entire thing. It’s not for the squeamish but I understand a whole lot more about my body now, and I don’t know how I would possibly have learned that without seeing quite so many bodies and parts of bodies. I’ll… stop talking before this sounds creepy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-bodyworlds-nervoussystem.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/vondelpark-ducks-fountains.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a quiet couple of days before reaching Berlin, so it’s time to catch up with my writing starting with Day 4’s journey from Paris to Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing on Day 4, I needed to get some eyedrops. I suffer from dry eyes sometimes and they’re handy to have around. For more or less the first time I didn’t even try to ask for them in French - I thought the name would be far too esoteric to guess at. But they have a name I could have grasped at: &lt;em&gt;l’hydration les yeux&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second we caught a taxi from our hotel to Gare Du Nord, Paris’ north-bound station. The taxi was a Tesla and, while a big LCD screen is cool, I was surprised how simple its interior decor otherwise is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With about an hour to spare I found a few things to do. I got a sausage baguette and what I’d expected to be a Tartalette Citron. As it turned out I think they gave me an apple one by mistake, but it still proved a delicious farewell to Paris. I helped a few London-bound Americans who were staring at the Eurostar trains unsure how to access them - the answer being to turn right, walk 100m down the concourse to an out-of-sight escalator, and go upstairs (really rather tricky to spot.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a pretty long chat with a few Americans who were also getting lunch. Originally we started talking because the three of us seemed to be prime targets for beggars - the extent of it in Paris was honestly a surprise. For better or for worse, my experiences at the Louvre have me &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; wary. But it was interesting to talk to fellow travellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;parisamsterdam&quot;&gt;Paris–Amsterdam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on the 12:28 Thalys service from Paris Gare Du Nord–Amsterdam Centraal, a 3h51m journey by modern high-speed train. The overhead baggage racks could contain remarkably luggage, and then I somehow managed to sit in the seat in front of mine which was rather embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading North towards Lille and the Belgian border was quite similar to Day 1’s Eurostar journey, although I’m not sure if we were on the same train tracks. Our first major stop was Brussels-Midi (seen below), roughly 18 hours after a failed/foiled bomber at Brussels-Centrale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/brussels-station-approach.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My position on terror attacks largely focuses on the actual risk. Few terrorist attacks in the West have come close to existential damage to their people or infrastructure, and thus it is generally safe to disregard them day-to-day. But the risk to society seems somewhat greater—the media profile and political urge to take some sort of action about even the smallest attack is vast. Carrying on and keeping calm seems the immediate way to counter that individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading on into The Netherlands I received my third new reason to thank the EU of my trip: a text from Vodafone taking credit for no roaming charges and my data/texts/minutes working throughout the EU. This only came into force last week and has made my trip far easier, cheaper and perhaps safer than it otherwise would have been!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final leg to Amsterdam was very cute. The fields with regular drainage ditches reminded me of the Norfolk Broads only on a fantastically larger scale. The motorways and a lot of the houses seemed surprisingly reminiscent of UK suburbia. Something eye-opening was the train crossing a large body of water by bridge and immediately on the other side going sharply down below the waterlevel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/netherland-drainage-intersection.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/rotterdam-platform.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;first-evening-in-amsterdam&quot;&gt;First evening in Amsterdam&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amsterdam did prove to be lovely in the sun. The heatwave had temperatures around 30°C. After an fun hour wandering to my AirBNB, I was rather happy to relax in a nearby park (the Vondelpark I mention above) and do some reading. Oh, and go to a gay bar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-canal.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vondelpark is absolutely gorgeous in 30°C - sadly I doubt it gets that weather too often:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/amsterdam-type-of-boy-sandwich.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
Conclusions from Paris
- The walk bit not worth doing, go towards 16th or Sacre-Coeur instead
- Paris eats and drinks late
- Use CityMapper to get around (even more useful than in London, as the transport map is quite complex)
- Paris largely because I'd have company. In practice an extremely enjoyable destination.
- I want to go back having learned more French (Duolingo.) Perhaps to the countryside or a different city, however.

I’ve been here before with family, but my memories were limited to a hawker at the Eiffel Tower and getting my shoelace stuck in an escalator at the Disneyland Paris train station.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--First a confession: I disliked French at school. I didn't know much of anything about France, didn't holiday there and I believe the first French person I spent serious time with was a French teacher who moved over from France and my interest in the subject did dramatically increase when under their tutoring. Perhaps the French person I know best know from startups days is Mathieu, but I haven't had time to see them.--&gt;

&lt;!--I have two full days in Paris, Amsterdam and Berlin which gives one day to explore and one day to do particular activities (perhaps, later in the trip, sleep.) Paris was a weird one in that I'm expecting to hop back by Eurostar sometime soon and had already booked Disneyland Paris for that second full day.--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have time to include in &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/wakefield-to-paris/&quot;&gt;Day 1’s post&lt;/a&gt; our trip to the Eiffel Tower on the first night we got there, reaching the summit a little after 10pm and just as the lights came on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/eiffel-over-buildings.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/live-street.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sunset-over-la-defense.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we had trouble on the way to Paris we had joked that a McDonalds near the hotel was open until 2am if we were to get in that late. As it turned out we did resort to eating there, at about 1am on the way back from the Eiffel Tower! We’d assumed that it would be the only place serving food, but in hindsight I get the impression that a proper French bistro would have been able to feed us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t sleep (as is typical my first night somewhere) so got up pretty late the next day. I caught up with Sarah on the Champs de Mars (the D.C. Mall-style area in front of the Eiffel Tower), and we took in an obvious tourist route from there to the Trocadero, up past the Arc de Triomphe, down the Champs-Elysees, through the Louvre and to Notre Dame - a few hours walk. My companion wasn’t a huge fan of figuring out public transport, so walking was a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sunny-street.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/trocadero-statue.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like building up mental maps of cities, but in hindsight I think the route was a mistake. Between the Trocadero and the Petit Palace end of Champs-Elysees was a fair distance and not hugely remarkable compared to the 15th we were staying in. In hindsight I’ve have caught the Metro towards Place de la Republique and spent an hour in a museum near in the Louvre, but it was still a nice walk through the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/petit-palais.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s me on the steps of Petit Palais, in a Yorkie Swing Dance t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we reached Place de la Republique by foot we were quite exhausted. The temperature was around 35°C and the trees lining the boulevards have a gap near there (and the breeze slowed.) We stumbled on through the gardens, still having fun but really in need of a drink, and targeted a Starbucks next to the Louvre. Our eventual arrival had us both limping… a bit of fun. Jumping for the coldest thing I could imagine, I ordered a Yaourt Banana Creme: a smoothie of (frozen?) yoghurt, banana, cream and ice. It was indeed the most cooling drink I could imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long recuperation in the cool, I headed out to wander the Louvre and reach Notre Dame. I got some nice shots of the Louvre pyramids and then got severely harassed by a group of fake petitioners who evidently thought me a good target - the point where six of them started to surround me was a little scary, but I distracted them long enough to get the hell out of there! I’m curious what their relationship with the police is - if not violent they might be left alone and yet the line between the harassment and violence is very thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that fright, I got a drink (in French, although I think I mistook how seating was supposed to work) and sat near Notre Dame. We planned to have a nice meal at a nice restaurant that evening, and I still had a few hours to use up before getting the Metro back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/metro.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d eyed a few places on Place Cambronne that had a lot of everyday French customers and looked quite nice, and we picked . It was a nice meal - Seabass and Vegetable Taglietele (spiralised and nicely cooked vegetables.) I’d been fancying some Rosé wine for days, and it is France, so I had… a little too much.&lt;/p&gt;

We’re taking two trains, the first from Wakefield (in Yorkshire) down to London and the second across to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first leg is fairly straightforward… in theory. A Virgin Trains East Coast service from Wakefield Westgate to London, using the Leeds Branch of the East Coast Mainline. 200 miles by rail, 2 hours, top speed of 125mph. In practice, it didn’t go so well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a farewell to our parents, the first thing we did at Wakefield Westgate was get our tickets down to London. Eurostar had provided us with a booking reservation number to collect them. We were rather surprised to get 1x Adult and 1x Child tickets, when we’re both rather older than the 16-year-old cutoff for Child tickets. After a glance at our Eurostar tickets it became clear that my Youth (12-25) ticket must have been booked with National Rail as a Child - a bug in an automated system, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wakefield Westgate ticket office couldn’t help, and my sister was booked on a specific train, so I had little choice but to buy a Super Off-Peak Single to London Kings Cross (£70 with my Railcard) and hope to receive a refund from Eurostar, given it was their mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had another 10 minutes before the train - far too little to talk to Eurostar and straighten things out - so we went to WHSmiths. Then we heard that our train to London was cancelled. Uh oh. So we waited an hour and got on the next service down - trusting that our thru-booking with Eurostar ensured no problems getting on the next leg to Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/eurostar-st-pancras.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having made it to London St Pancras, Eurostar Support were fantastic in person, and we got on the 15:31 to Paris (two hours later than planned) with some vouchers to make things up to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re about 5 minutes into the Channel Tunnel now. It’s remarkable how little light is outside compared to what I recall taking the Car Transporter with my Junior School. I recall regular orange floodlights outside the window. Now there’s just regular green LEDs every 2 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having just emerged into France, I’m struck by how huge the fields are compared to back home. Even the sparsely farmed hills of my origin are only 5 minutes walk a side - some of these I’m seeing must be as much as 20 minutes, but it does vary. I also notice the ballast is a much lighter colour, the houses a more angular and cleaner design. The pylons are different - not a million miles different, but noticably different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/eurostar-france-house.jpg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent the evening going up the Eiffel Tower, but I’m out of time to finish writing or find good nighttime pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m excited and a little nervous to have settled my next steps (see upcoming posts), and I’m starting with two weeks travelling Europe by train.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This trip will start to address how little of Europe I’ve visited. For many years most of my holidays have been to the USA. I’ve loved, worked with and visited Americans, and been to about 20 states. I’d like to get to know Europe better in the next couple of years, and then diversify my destinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with I planned a short trip to Amsterdam and Berlin. But I found some company, time and money so I’ve extended matters a lot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;June 18th: &lt;strong&gt;Wakefield–London–Paris&lt;/strong&gt; (VTEC and Eurostar)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;June 21st: &lt;strong&gt;Paris–Amsterdam&lt;/strong&gt; (Thalys)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;June 24th: &lt;strong&gt;Amsterdam–Hannover&lt;/strong&gt; (DB IC)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;June 25th: &lt;strong&gt;Hannover–Berlin&lt;/strong&gt; (DB ICE)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;June 28th: &lt;strong&gt;Berlin–Prague&lt;/strong&gt; (DB EC)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;June 29th: &lt;strong&gt;Prague–Manchester&lt;/strong&gt; (easyjet flight)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This follows an n-shaped train route east, and I’m rather interested to see the countryside and culture change even across a relatively small part of Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way we’ll see Paris’s Catacombs and Disneyland, Amsterdam’s architecture, Hannover’s Herrenhäuser Gardens, Berlin’s Holocaust Memorials and Museum Island, the Elbe River Valley, Prague’s language and beauty, and lots besides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prague will be the furthest East I’ve ever been, while Mount Tamalpais near San Francisco is the most West I’ve been. Sometime soon I’d like to make the furthest North be Svalbard, and push eastward to Greece and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://intarch.ac.uk/journal/issue20/taesp_index.html&quot;&gt;Troodos Mountains in Cyprus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll hopefully be posting along the way :-)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In New Horizons last month I talked about submitting my dissertation and planning what came next.

So from my perspective I’m pretty much done and awaiting Graduation come July!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Masters year was exhausting and I’m a little burned out, so I’m hoping not to rush into anything. I’ve wanted to go travelling in Europe for a few years now but kept finding interesting internships instead. Now between University and what-comes-after I have a natural gap.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends, culture and history put Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Greece on the list. I’d like to follow Archaeological data I worked with into the Troodos Mountains in Cyprus, but that would be a trip in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“And the danger is that in this move toward new horizons and far directions, that I may lose what I have now, and not find anything except loneliness.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;—Sylvia Plath, The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That quote above is one a friend sent me. They’re moving back to east Asia, away from the friends they’ve made here in York and back to a different culture. I sympathise in my own way: I grew up in an isolated village and adopted York as my hometown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over these six years London, Hamburg, the San Francisco Bay Area, Cambridge, MA and a few other cities in the U.S. have gained wonderful memories as well. This shows I don’t have to worry, and yet the Plath quote remains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve chatted with a lot of people about what to do next. It needs to be a step up, and yet it’s hard to know what a step up from effective-CTO of a technically hard startup would be. Delivering in a larger organisation? “Cross-functional agile teams?” Engineering technically-harder things? Making better startup decisions the second time around?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m gonna find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
End of the day, it just has to be rewarding and worthwhile while either paying the bills or working around them.

The UK has taken a disturbing turn in the last year, and I don't quite know what it means for my or our future.

It’s a sandbox game, where you place roads and buildings and simulated people (&lt;em&gt;sims&lt;/em&gt;) live out their lives in the world you’ve built.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sims arrive by train, move into their &lt;span style=&quot;padding: 0 6px; background: green; color: white; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;houses&lt;/span&gt;, visit &lt;span style=&quot;padding: 0 6px; background: purple; color: white; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;general stores&lt;/span&gt; for their groceries, visit &lt;span style=&quot;padding: 0 6px; background: blue; color: white; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;saloons&lt;/span&gt; to drink and find work, and then work in &lt;span style=&quot;padding: 0 6px; background: red; color: white; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;factories&lt;/span&gt;. Play the video to see it in action:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;position:relative;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:90.05%;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;294&quot; style=&quot;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z_5WOXicQbc?rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&amp;amp;modestbranding=1&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still early days and I’ve been experimenting with sims building their own roads, more efficient pathfinding, and properly simulating an economy. The representation of buildings as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1x1&lt;/code&gt; squares is something I find cute, and I plan to make them bigger on the inside than the outside similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mods.factorio.com/mods/MagmaMcFry/Factorissimo&quot;&gt;Factorissimo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tilewater originated out of a bit of ennui. I submitted my dissertation, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://r.46b.it/timelapse-extrapolation.pdf&quot;&gt;Time-lapse Extrapolation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, last Tuesday. Getting it done was intense, as those of you who have done degrees no-doubt relate to. In the preceding weekend I’d worked 26 hours solid and then 14 or 16 the next, surrounded by 5 whiteboards and a useful &lt;a href=&quot;https://trello.com/b/zybbxNTX/project-sections&quot;&gt;Trello board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I had a lot of free time! I slept and cycled and partied and had a great time. I’d been acting like a workaholic since March 22nd, and it takes time to fix that burnout. But after a few days started to feel a bit dissatisfied and aimless. So I took a project idea and ran with it. This time last year was when we started working on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sirpent-team/sirpent-rust&quot;&gt;sirpent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been watching a lot of Westworld lately, and I loved the idea of simulating frontier towns. In practice Tilewater is a long way from that idea, but having bandits run into town might happen in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how much further I’ll develop Tilewater for the time being - I’ve been enjoying the sunshine and my books a bit more. But provided you’re a little bit technical you can &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/46bit/tilewater&quot;&gt;play Tilewater by following the directions on Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Tilewater is a little sandbox game I’ve built in Rust.

Much has been written about its spread and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.malwaretech.com/2017/05/how-to-accidentally-stop-a-global-cyber-attacks.html&quot;&gt;MalwareTech’s heroic but accidental halting of its spread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The British prime minister, Theresa May, and NHS Digital said they were not aware of any evidence that patient records had been compromised in the attack. May said: “This is not targeted at the NHS, it’s an international attack and a number of countries and organisations have been affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would seem to be true. WannaCrypt did not exfiltrate data from SMB shares, merely encrypting it. But this is only true because its motivation was extorting BitCoins. A more strategic attacker could have infiltrated at least as deeply, accessing systems that deal with highly-confidential patient data. This could be used for information, influence, or as a weapon.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--This gives an excellent view of how effective an attacker with different motives could be. WannaCrypt is a BitCoin extortion scheme, but other attackers (such as the vulnerability's presumed original discover, the NSA) are probably more interested in gathering information. It's clear this malware reached computers used to access highly-confidential patient databases and handle medical scans. WannaCrypt disabled the systems, but a more systematic attack could retrieve or manipulate information.--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Government bought an extension when Microsoft ended Windows XP support in 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;https://governmenttechnology.blog.gov.uk/2015/05/22/update-on-the-customer-support-agreement-for-windows-xp/&quot;&gt;and then ended it in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The idea seems to be that individual areas of government would buy support if needed, but with so many NHS machines vulnerable two months after a patch was released for this vulnerability we can assume that didn’t go to plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It effectively means that unless individual trusts were willing to pay Microsoft for an extended support deal, since May 2015 their operating systems have been extremely vulnerable to being hacked.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/13/jeremy-hunt-ignored-warning-signs-before-cyber-attack-hit-nhs&quot;&gt;Letter from the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, as relayed by The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of this attack within the NHS is not so remarkable when looking at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/26/uk-government-pcs-open-to-hackers-as-paid-windows-xp-support-ends&quot;&gt;comments on The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from the time the support contract was cancelled. Some government offices have clearly migrated but others have not. Apparently this is still the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“All XP machines were banned from accessing the network some time ago. There are still some around but they aren’t connected and therefore don’t represent a threat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure why this is still a problem. I work in the public sector and there was a programme to replace or upgrade XP machines. After a certain date XP machines were banned from accessing the network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Currently running XP, as do 90% of the computers of the organisation. NHS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of Ministry of Justice PCs still run XP (and Office 2003). Priority is inevitably being given to its Whitehall HQ. The hicks in the sticks will just have to wait till heaven knows when; years probably. Any sense of urgency is wholly absent yet at a time when further cuts are being demanded it’s apparently ok to spend money keeping software they have had 7 years to upgrade secure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That this support is still available is remarkable - but necessary. Relatively few Software Engineers would relish working on Windows XP patches sixteen years after its original release. That Microsoft offer such an option is testament to how critical Windows XP machines remain in many organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues may be getting worse over time. The situation is apparently &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; with Android: modern phones would seem to be properly supported for about two years. Even during that time, security patches can be delayed a long time by the phone’s vendor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--Earlier this year I briefly talked about an engineering role with NHS Digital. What I saw of salaries there was extremely underwhelming even on a Leeds cost-of-living, although I can't be certain of its accuracy. If salaries are so low then they rule themselves out of a great deal of talent, and either way it's clear that the NHS is in need of a major funding boost.--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimistically this front-page news story (and potentially deaths!) will lead to a major investment and improvement to NHS and Government IT. In practice I am less than convinced such efforts will be sustained. Immediate, obvious issues will be fixed but as time moves on it might be forgotten until this happens again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can hope for better. GDS seems to have transformed much of the public-facing Government IT into an improved state, and the same could happen for internal infrastructure. In addition, this could be a critical example when opposing Government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/04/uk_bulk_surveillance_powers_draft/&quot;&gt;hopes to mandate backdoors&lt;/a&gt;, if such arguments are properly used by campaigners. In the wake of this I think I’ll contact my MP and give feedback on the wider issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">WannaCrypt is the malware whose remarkable spread from mass emails to leaping across vulnerable SMB servers has led to major problems for many organisations in the last few days - in particular the NHS.

Day 1 has some cybersecurity competitions, and a team of 3 of us participated in the Software Development stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been to a lot of hackdays—between 16 and 20 I won prizes in at least six of them. I picked up a minimal-product/prototyping mindset, but it was hard to keep going afterwards. Over time my enthusiasm waned. The time limits, intensity and limited feedback hindered stretching my boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This competition seemed quite interesting because writing Cryptography-related software is hard.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s hard to start off in the right direction, and easy to screw up later on. As such having professional feedback on an interesting day of work sounded great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;our task was to build encrypted local partitions.&lt;/strong&gt; We had to build a system which stored encrypted keys on USB keys. Inserting such a USB key automatically prompted users to authenticate for a particular key. The encrypted volume was then to be used as a virtual drive.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-begins&quot;&gt;Work begins&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sdhand&quot;&gt;@sdhand&lt;/a&gt;) is a first-year Computer Scientist at York, and he focused on detecting USB drives and getting the system + GUI together. Chongyang (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/icydoge&quot;&gt;@icydoge&lt;/a&gt;) concentrated on the encryption using &lt;a href=&quot;https://download.libsodium.org/doc/secret-key_cryptography/authenticated_encryption.html&quot;&gt;NaCl AEAD&lt;/a&gt;. I took on something new to me: engineering the encrypted drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a little research, we settled on a FUSE filesystem wrapper. FUSE provides a virtual disk drive with a custom filesystem - for instance &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs&quot;&gt;sshfs&lt;/a&gt;. For our usecase, we encrypt writes and decrypt reads so that the data is encrypted when on physical disk but decrypted when accessed. FUSE was completely new to me and rather exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to get deeper into the Systems side of things, and this was a new experience. Operating on memories of reading about ordinary disk encryption, my first implementation decision was whether to encrypt the entire filesystem or each file individually. Encrypting each individual file has many disadvantages, most notably that the metadata of files (e.g., their name) is unobscured. We only had 5 hours (far shorter than it sounds if you get stuck!) and so I chose to do it file-by-file, with this as an important caveat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sketched out a plan for how each API method could adapt to our encrypted filesystem. Opening files would read and decrypt file contents into memory; reading files would output that in-memory plaintext; writing files would update that plaintext and encrypt it to disk; flushing or closing files would encrypt it to disk. File descriptors (handles to open files) were handled simply by giving the same integer for each file path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;debugging-nul&quot;&gt;Debugging &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NUL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This worked rather well until I started hitting difficult debugging issues. I was getting mysterious &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NUL&lt;/code&gt; bytes when reading and writing files, and despite a number of bugfixes I could not seem to fix the final issue. For the powerful ecosystem and rapid development we were working with Python, and various issues forced us to mix &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bytes&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bytearray&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; in one class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no testsuite. I hadn’t found one when getting some example code and I wasn’t convinced such a tight timebound was enough to repay the slower development time. So facing tough issues I radically simplified and stopped storing decrypted contents in memory. Every time file contents were needed the entire file was decrypted. I felt that once this simpler form worked I could easily re-add the complexity. I feel the in-memory approach was easy enough to not be premature optimisation, but it did prove to add too much indirection for how unfamiliar I was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This final issue was that files were mysteriously having &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NUL&lt;/code&gt; bytes appended each time they were saved. Nothing I did could fix the issue, to the extent it was bizarre. Stuck, I warned Sam and Chongyang I’d hit a blocking issue. Chongyang and I were able to simplify away some ugly code but couldn’t address the problem. &lt;strong&gt;Thankfully Sam has built an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sdhand/x11fs&quot;&gt;X11 filesystem&lt;/a&gt; and realised we weren’t giving correct filesizes!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One method of the FUSE API that filesystems implement is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getattr&lt;/code&gt;. This provides metadata on items in the filesystem, including the sizes of files. Sam noticed that we were passing through the size of the encrypted files rather than the decrypted ones! This was rather bad: our encrypted files were padded with a nonce value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our code was built in a hurry. Nonetheless, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/46bit/liverpool&quot;&gt;liverpool on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was rather interested to have our Cryptography-related work reviewed, but in practice this didn’t work so well. I’m not sure if the judges were non-technical or just had a “gold standard” they were seeking but there wasn’t effective feedback. Nonetheless an enjoyable day and we’ve reviewed things ourselves on the train back to York.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/coldfusion-insecure-escape-spaces/&quot;&gt;Security work I’ve done for IT Services here in York&lt;/a&gt;, and with graduation soon approaching I’ve considered going deeply into cybersecurity. But I’d rather bring my security mindset to more typical engineering roles. I have a rough plan to take an ethical hacking certification in my spare time once I’m settled after graduation, as I’d like to make security a more formal part of my role over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our code was built in a hurry. Nonetheless, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/46bit/liverpool&quot;&gt;liverpool on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Today I’ve been at a mini-hackday in Liverpool, part of the National Conference for Learning and Teaching in Cyber Security. Day 1 has some cybersecurity competitions, and a team of 3 of us participated in the Software Development stream. I’ve been to a lot of hackdays—between 16 and 20 I won prizes in at least six of them. I picked up a minimal-product/prototyping mindset, but it was hard to keep going afterwards. Over time my enthusiasm waned. The time limits, intensity and limited feedback hindered stretching my boundaries. This competition seemed quite interesting because writing Cryptography-related software is hard. It’s hard to start off in the right direction, and easy to screw up later on. As such having professional feedback on an interesting day of work sounded great. So, our task was to build encrypted local partitions. We had to build a system which stored encrypted keys on USB keys. Inserting such a USB key automatically prompted users to authenticate for a particular key. The encrypted volume was then to be used as a virtual drive.</summary></entry></feed>
