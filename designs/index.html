				<h2><a href="#">PRNG implementations in Pinocchio</a></h2>
				<p class="date">April 22, 2014</p>
				<!--<p class="inbrief">As much as I love cryptography I have felt mortally afraid of random number generation. Even the most secure encryption method is doomed to failure if you get it wrong yet most computers (let alone embedded microcontrollers) operate on hope alone. Starting with a talk I gave on how to beat old slot machines, I've been building a software library named Pinocchio to act as a self-contained toolkit for many common past and present generator systems.</p>-->

				<h2><a href="#">Accelerating Soil topology processing with GPUs</a></h2>
				<p class="date">May 25, 2014</p>
				<p class="inbrief">I've been living on my own (or rather in shared houses) for a few years now and I've finally got to the point of wanting a bit more interesting decoration. One of the fascinating things about growing up in the foothills of the Pennine hills is that you're surrounded by river valleys too large to really grasp, and settlements that often grew haphazardly around or above them. I've been building Soil, an online store for models of your favourite regions on Earth using public topology data.</p>

				<h2><a href="#">Camera motion in Game of Thrones</a></h2>
				<p class="date">August 3, 2014</p>
				<p class="inbrief">One of the wonderful things about the intro sequence of GoT is the way the camera appears to be at the center of a sphere. If you watch closely you'll notice that the camera pans about the world with both rotation and some movement - as if it is contained within a sphere itself and the camera is off-centre.</p>
